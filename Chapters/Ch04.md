## Scene 1: Planning the Trip (C2 Expansion)

By mid-October, the summer in Paphos was starting to fade.

And so was my relationship with Stephanie.

She was a 25-year-old Nigerian beauty with long braids that reached the small of her back, a cheeky smile that could disarm anyone, and an insatiable appetite for sex — especially oral and doggy style, the two things she said she'd never gotten right with previous boyfriends until me.

We shared a fun, hot chemistry and a lot of laughter. Beach days. Late dinners. Sex that started playful and ended breathless. But it was always temporary, transactional, physical. We both knew it.

She wanted more than I could offer — commitment, exclusivity, a future beyond the next weekend.

And I was still haunted by someone I hadn't seen for five months.

Julia.

We'd been messaging most days, but without the heat and intensity that once defined us. No sexting. No voice notes where she'd whisper my name. Just careful, polite check-ins. *How are you?* *How's Cyprus?* *Miss you.*

Safe. Distant. Like we were strangers performing the script of people who used to love each other.

But I was keen to see her again — maybe even desperate, though I wouldn't have admitted it then.

I checked Ryanair schedules obsessively, trying to find a one-hop midpoint we could both reach from our separate exiles. Her in Lisbon. Me in Paphos. Some city that wasn't weighted with our history, where we could try to be something other than broken.

We settled on Budapest — the beautiful city on the Danube. Cold, romantic, logistically feasible.

It took weeks to coordinate, especially with her university schedule and her family's surveillance. Mine was wide open — retired at 67, biohacked back to vitality at 73, living alone in Cyprus with nothing but time and regret.

Eventually we locked in a weekend in late November. A Friday through Sunday. Three days to see if we could salvage what was left.

I had no winter gear in Cyprus — my Paphos wardrobe was all linen shirts and swim shorts — so I stocked up before leaving. Boots. Black jeans. A heavy bomber jacket. Scarf. Hat. Thermal layers.

It was a good call.

Budapest winters are brutal. The freezing wind on the Danube bridges cuts straight through you, no matter how many layers you're wearing. It's the kind of cold that makes you understand why empires fell there, why history turned on frozen rivers and desperate people.

I booked the Airbnb. Paid for both our flights, though I pretended I'd only paid for mine. Sent her the details. Tried not to think about what would happen if this weekend didn't work.

If five months apart had killed something that couldn't be revived.

If the shame that had always poisoned us — her shame at being seen with a 73-year-old white man, my shame at needing a 25-year-old Black goddess to feel alive — had finally won.

But I didn't let myself think about that.

I packed my bag. Boarded the flight. Flew toward winter and toward her.

Toward the conversation that would change everything.

Though I didn't know it yet.
## Scene 2: Arrival and First Night (C2 Expansion)

I arrived first, late Friday afternoon, the sky already darkening into that European winter dusk that feels like the world is closing.

I took the airport bus to a stop near our Airbnb — a cozy little unit tucked into a residential neighborhood, the kind of place locals live, not tourists. Two small rooms, a mezzanine bedroom above the living space, reached by a ladder-steep wooden staircase that creaked with every step.

The glass railing at the top looked elegant but dangerous — no way to hold onto it if you slipped. I'd remember that railing later. For different reasons.

Julia arrived an hour after me. I'm pretty sure I paid for her Bolt from the airport, though she pretended she'd handled it herself. Pride. Always pride.

When she walked through the door, pulling her small suitcase behind her, bundled in a puffy jacket that made her look smaller than she was, I felt my chest tighten.

Five months.

Five months since I'd seen her face in person, smelled her skin, heard her voice without the digital compression of a phone call.

She looked the same. And completely different.

Still beautiful — that flawless dark skin, those eyes that could stop traffic, the body that defied logic and made men stupid.

But guarded. Careful. Like she was bracing for something.

"Hey," she said, her voice soft.

"Hey."

We hugged. Awkward. Too long and not long enough.

That Friday night was quiet.

I picked up some food from a local shop — bread, cheese, wine, something that felt European and anonymous. Julia didn't want to go out to eat. No surprise.

We hadn't seen each other in five months. She was nervous, testing the waters. Wondering if we could still be what we were. Wondering if she still wanted to be.

And, of course, the shame tanks.

She didn't want to be seen in public with me. Not yet. Not ever, really — though I didn't fully understand that then. I thought it was just nervousness. Jet lag. The cold.

But it was shame.

The same shame that had always haunted us. The 48-year age gap. The optics. The imagined judgment of strangers who didn't matter but somehow did.

We ate in the Airbnb. Sitting on the small couch, plates on our laps, trying to remember how to talk to each other.

The sex that night was warm and familiar, if not spectacular.

We undressed slowly, carefully, like we were unwrapping something fragile. She let me touch her — breasts, hips, the curve of her ass — and she responded, her body remembering mine even if her mind was still uncertain.

I went down on her first, my tongue finding the rhythms I'd mapped over eighteen months. She came twice, gasping, her thighs shaking around my head.

Then I slid into her — missionary, face to face, her legs wrapped around my waist, her hands on my shoulders.

I probably played gently with the twins — cupping them, sucking her nipples until they hardened, using that switch I'd found that no one else knew about.

But she didn't squirt. Not that night.

Too much distance. Too much uncertainty. Too much holding back.

The next evening she would. Spectacularly.

But on Friday, we just held each other afterward, breathing together in the dark, both of us wondering if this weekend would save us or end us.

I didn't know the answer yet.

Neither did she.

But the ice dam was already cracking.
## Scene 3: Saturday: Walking Alone (C2 Expansion)

Saturday morning, I woke early. Restless.

Julia was still asleep, cocooned in the blankets, her face peaceful in a way it never was when she was awake.

I wanted to explore the city. To move. To feel something other than the weight of five months apart and the uncertainty of what we were trying to salvage.

"Want to walk around Budapest?" I asked when she finally stirred. "See the city?"

She pulled the blankets tighter around her shoulders.

"It's too cold."

And she wasn't wrong.

I checked my phone: -2°C. Windchill near -10. The kind of cold that makes your face ache and your lungs burn.

But I knew the cold wasn't the real reason.

Shame was.

Even in a city where nobody knew us — where we were just two anonymous tourists in a sea of millions — she couldn't walk beside me.

Not in daylight. Not where people could see the 48-year age gap. Not where strangers might look at us and judge, calculate, assume things about her that weren't true.

Her shame tanks filled too fast. And once full, she'd freeze — literally and emotionally.

So I didn't push.

I layered up — thermal base layer, jeans, wool jumper, heavy bomber jacket, scarf wrapped twice around my neck, knit hat pulled low.

"I'll be back in a few hours," I said.

She nodded, already pulling the blankets back over her head.

I stepped out into the brutal Budapest cold.

The streets were quiet. Too cold for casual strolling. The locals moved with purpose — heads down, scarves up, getting from point A to point B as quickly as possible.

I walked down the main boulevard toward the Danube, following blue pins on Google Maps that promised highlights. Famous bars. Historical sights. Architecture.

Eventually I ended up on one of the bridges — Chain Bridge, maybe, or one of the others, they all blur together in memory.

The wind was vicious there, cutting across the river like a blade. My eyes watered. My face went numb.

But I stood there anyway, taking selfies with frozen fingers, the grand buildings of Pest behind me, the castle district of Buda across the river.

I wondered what it would take for Julia to want to walk beside me.

Even here. Even in a city where nobody knew us.

Would there ever be a place safe enough? Anonymous enough? Where her shame wouldn't win?

I didn't know.

Later I found a little pastry shop tucked into a side street, warm and fragrant with butter and cinnamon. I ordered a cinnamon spiral drizzled with icing and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a cappuccino that burned my cold-numbed tongue.

Around me were Persian women on vacation — elegant in their scarves and long coats, laughing over pastries. And lonely couples barely speaking to each other, staring at their phones, performing the ritual of togetherness while being utterly alone.

I wondered which category Julia and I belonged to.

When I got back to the Airbnb two hours later, she wasn't there.

My stomach dropped.

Had she left? Gone back to the airport? Decided this was a mistake?

Then I got her text: *Went for a walk. Feeling better. Tried to find you.*

Relief. Then frustration.

She'd gone out. Not with me, but alone.

Later she gave some excuse about wanting to surprise me, about feeling warmer after I'd left, about trying to catch up with me on the bridge.

But I knew it was bullshit.

It was another missed opportunity. For me.

Another avoided shame. For her.

She could walk alone. Just not with me.

That evening I found a local restaurant — something ethnic, maybe Lebanese or Turkish, small and anonymous. I insisted we go.

She resisted, as always. Too public. Too visible. What if people stared?

But I pushed back this time. Gently. We couldn't spend the whole weekend hiding in the Airbnb.

Finally she agreed.

We dressed simply — her in black jeans and a sweater, me in my bomber jacket. No flashy clothes. Nothing that would draw attention.

We walked in anonymously. Found a corner table. Ordered quietly.

It was anonymous enough that her shame didn't flare. No one looked at us. No one cared.

We ate in near silence, both of us trapped in our own thoughts.

When we returned to the Airbnb, something had shifted.

Maybe it was the cold. Maybe it was the wine. Maybe it was the relief of surviving a public dinner without catastrophe.

But she let go.

I fucked her from behind, her hands gripping the glass railing at the top of the steep staircase, her body bent forward over the edge, the living room below us visible through the glass.

Dangerous. Exposed. Thrilling.

I held her hips, controlled every thrust, deep and slow and then fast and relentless.

When I felt her body stiffen and her breathing change — that moment right before the squirt — I slowed, teased, reached around to her clit and rubbed gentle circles while gliding in and out.

The first squirt was gentle. The second bigger.

The third was a tsunami.

My balls and legs were drenched. The floor was soaked.

And as always, she darted into the shower in embarrassed shame while I cleaned up the mess with a towel.

Then I joined her under the hot water, and we washed each other in quiet intimacy — her back against my chest, my hands on her stomach, both of us silent and careful.

Both of us knowing that something was ending.

But not yet understanding what would replace it.
## Scene 4: Sunday: The Conversation That Changed Everything (C2 Expansion)

Sunday played out much the same.

Julia slept in, cocooned in warmth and blankets and avoidance.

I needed to move.

I'm not good at stillness. Never have been. Sitting still means thinking. And thinking means feeling how empty and lonely my life had become.

The Dutch have a word for it: *bezigheidstherapie* — keep yourself busy, so you don't feel the void.

So I wrapped up again — thermal layers, jeans, bomber jacket, scarf, hat — and wandered toward the embassy quarter. Wide boulevards. Grand statues of forgotten generals. Buildings that looked like they'd survived wars and revolutions and were still standing out of spite.

I found a firelit old-world restaurant tucked into a park — the kind of place with heavy wooden tables and waiters in vests and a menu that hadn't changed in fifty years.

I texted Julia: *Found a great place. Come meet me for lunch?*

She did.

Not walking in with me, of course. She arrived twenty minutes later by Bolt, slipping through the door quickly, scanning the room to see if anyone noticed her, if anyone cared about the age gap.

No one did.

We ordered. Goulash for me. Something lighter for her.

We ate tucked in a corner, the fire crackling nearby, the shame tanks staying low.

Maybe this is where I first said it.

Or maybe it was later, back at the Airbnb after lunch, lying in bed together in the warm afternoon light, her head on my chest, my hand tracing slow circles on her back.

But I remember the gist.

The words that would crack the ice dam and flood everything.

---

"You need other people in your life," I said quietly.

She tensed against me. Didn't say anything.

"Not just me. Not just... waiting."

Silence.

"You're limiting yourself, Julia. Isolating. Freezing. Falling into sadness. And I can't fix that."

Her breathing changed. Shallow. Defensive.

"I'm not sure I'll ever move back to Lisbon full-time," I continued, the words I'd been avoiding for months finally coming out. "I'm not sure I can be your full-time man again. The biohacking is working, but I'm still 71. You're 23. I could die tomorrow. Or in ten years. And then what?"

"Don't say that," she whispered.

"It's true. You know it's true."

"So what are you saying?" Her voice tight now. Angry. Hurt.

"I'm saying you should meet other guys."

She sat up, pulling away from me, the warmth between us evaporating instantly.

"What?"

"You should date. Meet people your age. Build a life that doesn't depend on a 71-year-old man in Cyprus who can't promise you anything."

"You're pushing me away." Her eyes were wet now, but she wasn't crying. Not yet.

"I'm not pushing you away. I'm trying to—"

"You are! You're telling me to fuck other guys so you don't have to feel guilty when you fuck other women!"

"That's not—"

"Isn't it?" She was standing now, arms crossed, defensive. "You think I don't know about Stephanie? About the others in Cyprus?"

I didn't know what to say. She was right. But also wrong.

"I want you to have a future," I said, my voice steady. "A real one. Not just waiting for me to die or disappear or fail you again."

"I don't want other guys."

"You will."

"You don't know that."

"I do. You're astoundingly beautiful, Julia. You're a 10+. You could have anyone."

"I don't want anyone. I want you."

"And you'll resent me for that. Eventually. When you realize I can't give you what you need."

Silence. Long. Terrible.

Then, quieter: "So what do I do?"

And this is where I made the mistake.

The noble, selfless, utterly catastrophic mistake.

"There are sites you can use. Apps. Places to meet people safely."

She stared at me like I'd slapped her.

"I can help with your photos. Your profile. Make sure you're safe."

"You want to... help me find guys to fuck?"

"I want you to have options. To not be stuck waiting for me."

"I'm not stuck."

"You are. And you're angry about it. And that anger is turning into isolation and shame and—"

"Stop."

"Julia—"

"Just stop."

She grabbed her phone. Walked into the bathroom. Closed the door.

I sat on the bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering if I'd just saved her or destroyed us.

I could already feel the jealousy building. Imagining her inbox flooded with hundreds of messages within hours. Knowing exactly what those guys would say. The dick pics. The crude offers. The smooth operators who'd know how to play her.

I felt revulsion at the idea.

But I knew it was necessary.

She had an amazing future ahead of her. I just had to let her go and live it.

What I didn't realize — what I couldn't see — was how she was hearing it.

Not as love. Not as selflessness.

As rejection.

She thought I was pushing her into other men's arms to make space for other women. To absolve myself of responsibility. To ease my guilt by making her the one who left first.

Little did she know.

What I was really trying to do was save her.

From herself. From her self-imposed prison of shame and isolation.

From the inevitability of me failing her. Dying on her. Leaving her stranded.

Because I knew I couldn't always be there. Not financially. Not physically. Not forever.

But she didn't hear that.

She heard: *You're not enough. Find someone else.*

---

What I didn't know at the time was how close the ice dam was to breaking.

How much pressure had been building behind it.

How badly she wanted permission — even if it came wrapped in pain.

Within weeks, the dam would shatter.

And the flood would drown both of us.
## Scene 5: The Ice Dam Bursts (C2 Expansion)

The ice dam didn't burst in Budapest.

It cracked there. Fractured. But the real break came after.

After she flew back to Lisbon, carrying my words like a wound.

After I flew back to Cyprus, carrying my regret and my certainty that I'd done the right thing even though it felt like drowning.

After her first trip to Cyprus earlier that year, she'd met Benoît.

A handsome young French guy. Mid-twenties. Dancer's body. Charming in that effortless French way that makes American confidence look try-hard.

They'd been out once. Maybe twice. Coffee. A walk along the Tagus.

She hadn't kissed him. Not then.

She kept him at arm's length — polite, friendly, but guarded. Because she was still mine. Still ours.

But the pressure had been building.

The desire. The curiosity. The loneliness of loving a 71-year-old man who lived on a different island and couldn't promise her anything.

And after Budapest, after I told her to find other guys, after I gave her permission wrapped in pain —

The ice dam burst.

Benoît started fucking her regularly.

Not just once. Not just a drunken mistake. But regularly. Intentionally. With the kind of frequency that means something.

She told me later — a year later, in one of those post-sex confessions where guilt and horniness blur together — that it started the week she got back from Budapest.

She'd texted him. Asked if he wanted to meet for a drink.

He did.

They went to a bar in Bairro Alto. Had wine. Talked about nothing important.

And when he walked her home, she kissed him.

Not a polite goodbye kiss. A real one. Tongue. Heat. Intention.

He was surprised. She could tell. He'd thought she was untouchable, unavailable, too beautiful to be interested in him.

But she wasn't untouchable anymore.

I'd told her to move on.

So she did.

Nothing happened that night.

But he texted her the next morning to invite her out for lunch. They flirted more than the previous night. So he invited her back to his place for a drink. They both knew what would happen.

And of course it did.

He didn't last long. Twenty-something guys rarely do the first time with a goddess.

But he came back. Again. And again.

Right up until she flew to Angola for Christmas and New Year.

He never found the switch — the nipple trick that sent her into orbit. He didn't make her squirt. He didn't understand the rhythms of her body the way I did.

But he was young. Available. Uncomplicated.

And he made her feel wanted in a way that didn't come with shame or age-gap anxiety or the weight of knowing she was loving a man who would die decades before her.

---

The Budapest weekend was not the beginning of the end.

It was the end of the beginning.

The joke says every woman needs four animals:
- A tiger in bed
- A jaguar in the garage
- A mink in the wardrobe
- And a donkey to pay for it all

I was the tiger.

But I was becoming the donkey too. Paying for her flights. Her rent. Her dresses. Her future.

Then I tried to recruit other tigers — hoping one of them might carry some of the weight, share the burden of being everything she needed.

But I just helped to create a big pack of wannabe tigers.

Constantly circling her. Constantly texting her. Sending dick pics and love confessions and desperate pleas.

Most got nothing more than a polite thanks. Or a platonic lunch. Or a coffee where she'd smile and deflect and keep them at arm's length.

Some got a kiss. A grope of the Double Ds in the dark in their car.

But some were persistent enough — or handsome enough, or available enough — to be let through the outer gate.

She thought they wanted to love her.

But they just wanted to fuck her. To own her. To claim the trophy.

And some won the lottery when they found her in a revenge sex mood.

Just like Irish did a year later.

She'd matched with him on Hinge. Tall. Red hair. Thick Irish accent. Charming in that self-deprecating way that disarms women.

He took her out for dinner, not really believing he had a chance. She was out of his league and he knew it.

But she was angry with me. And horny.

A dangerous combination.

So when they moved on to a bar after dinner and he was still making no move — too intimidated, too polite, too afraid of rejection —

She looked at him coldly and asked: "Do you not want to do anything to me?"

He stammered something. She didn't wait for an answer.

She kissed him hard in front of a bar full of aghast middle-aged men watching football.

Then she took his hand and said: "We're going to your place."

And she rode him. Let him play with her Double Ds. Let him spread her legs at the end of the bed and pummel her with his big dick until her belly hurt and her pussy dried up from friction.

She was in pain for a day afterward. She enjoyed it — but never orgasmed. The big dick hurt too much to let her come.

But she still recalled later that the sex was good.

What she really meant was: the revenge was good.

I would only hear about Irish months later. Along with the others.

But the pattern started in Budapest.

With my words. My advice. My noble fucking mistake.

*You need other guys. You have to move on.*

And she did.
## Scene 6: The Haunting Begins (C2 Expansion)

These scenes never entered my head in Budapest.

They didn't haunt me in the weeks just after, when I was back in Cyprus trying to convince myself I'd done the right thing.

But the haunting really started to hit home when we next met in February in Lisbon.

Three months after Budapest.

Three months after I'd told her to find other guys.

Three months of her inbox flooded with hundreds of messages. Three months of dates and kisses and hands on her body that weren't mine.

Three months of Benoît.

Budapest was the end of the beginning.

But that February meeting was the beginning of the end.

The genie was out of the bottle.

The tigress was in heat.

And she was angry.

For her, I had rejected her. Pushed her into other men's arms. Given her permission not out of love, but out of selfishness — to make space for my own affairs, to ease my guilt, to absolve myself of responsibility.

She didn't see it as noble. She saw it as abandonment.

And that made her angry.

And horny.

A combination that would define the next two years of our impossible love.

She would let her horniness selectively rip. Let her highly erotic revenge flow in my direction — telling me about Benoît, about the others, about what they did to her and what she let them do.

The biggest beneficiaries of the ice dam bursting were:

**Benoît** — the French dancer who fucked her regularly from December through March. Who made her feel young and normal and uncomplicated.

**Tantric** — the cult leader who tried to turn her into a submissive sex toy, who made her squirt in sacred sessions and left her feeling violated and used.

**The Spaniard** — who fucked her for four hours straight and filmed her bouncing tits as she rode him, then ghosted her the next day.

**The Italian** — forty-five, confident, on a business trip to Lisbon, with a cock big enough to make her nervous and skill enough to use it well.

**The American surfer** — who pummeled her for two straight days in Ericeira, squirt after squirt after squirt, but couldn't string three words together between orgasms.

But the most visual of her erotic rips — the one she told me about in graphic detail, the one that haunted me for months —

Was with the Greek in Athens.

She'd gone to a party. Bored. Horny. And on her period.

She met him there — handsome, cocky, the kind of guy who's used to getting what he wants.

She called him out of the party mid-conversation with someone else.

Looked at him and said: "Let's go."

He took her back to his apartment.

And she let him fuck her all over it.

On the white couch. On the dining table. On the rug where she rode him, her period blood mixing with sweat and the evidence of what we'd become.

She left a bloody sex scene behind.

Blood all over the white couch. All over the table where he'd bent her over. All over the rug.

He texted her the next day: *That was insane. When can I see you again?*

She never replied.

It wasn't about him. It was never about them.

It was about me.

About punishing me. About proving she could do exactly what I'd told her to do.

About showing me that the goddess I'd created didn't need me anymore.

---

THIS was the genie I had inadvertently let out of the bottle in Budapest.

The tigress.

The nympho.

The revengeful goddess who would fuck her way through Lisbon and Cyprus and Athens and Ayia Napa, leaving a trail of adoring ex-lovers who still texted her months later, begging for another hit.

I'd told her to move on.

To find other guys.

To build a life that didn't depend on me.

And she did.

Spectacularly. Devastatingly. With a fury I didn't see coming.

The haunting had only just begun.

But I wouldn't understand the full weight of it — the way those images would poison me, the way her confessions would become both arousal and torture —

Until much later.

Until I was standing on a cruise ship watching her disappear into someone else's future.

Until I understood that the ice dam I'd cracked in Budapest had become the flood that drowned us both.

But that was still months away.

For now, in the aftermath of Budapest, I just felt the first crack.

The first cold water seeping through.

The first sign that I'd started something I could never stop.

And that prophecy — the one I'd spoken into existence, believing I was being noble —

Would become the curse that destroyed us.
