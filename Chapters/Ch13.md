## The Road to Granada
We left before the sun rose.
Two overnight bags. One bottle of champagne. A playlist we both liked.
She climbed into the passenger seat of the rental — big, Japanese, almost anonymous — and immediately kicked off her shoes. Her legs curled beneath her like a cat. I handed her the aux cable.
She grinned.
"Let's make some birthday memories," she said.
And for a while, it felt like we would.
The drive south through the Alentejo was glorious — olive groves, golden fields, villages still sleeping in morning mist. She wore a soft black hoodie, no makeup, hair loose and wild. She looked barely 20, like someone I'd picked up at a gas station café on the run from a predictable life. She sang along to Tyler and Chris Brown, held my hand between gear shifts, played DJ with mischievous intent.
We stopped just after noon in Seville. I found us a tucked-away place in the old town — all ceramic tiles and iron balconies. We ordered too much food, shared everything. Tapas on small plates, smiles across the table, bites fed by hand. She teased me for ordering a second glass of wine.
"You're not driving all the way to Africa," she laughed.
I said, "Only as far as paradise."
The afternoon sun hit her skin like honey.
Tourists looked at her.
Locals looked longer.
Men turned.
She didn't flinch — she glowed.
And I felt, in that moment, like the man who had won the prize everyone else was still trying to guess the rules for.
We arrived in Granada just after five. The hotel was modern and clean, not too flashy — but the bathroom mirror was good, and she cared about that. I carried our bags up, made a joke about ordering room service, and she rolled her eyes.
"Save your dad jokes for dinner, old man."
But she kissed me.
Soft, deliberate.
The kind of kiss that says, yes, we made it.
And for those first few hours, it felt like we had.

## Shame at Dinner
She looked like a movie star walking across the cobbled square from the Uber.
Tight red satin clinging to every curve. Matching red heels. A tiny red handbag dangling from her wrist like it was made just for that outfit. Her hair down, parted perfectly. Skin radiant, glowing, defiant.
Men stared.
Of course they did.
One man walked into a bollard. Another nearly tripped trying not to.
But she didn't laugh.
She didn't lean into it.
She walked like she was heading into a courtroom.
I had on my fitted cobalt-blue suit, freshly pressed white shirt, shiny black lace-ups. The kind of outfit that usually made her eyes linger — the "professor who fucks" vibe she once teased me about.
Tonight, it got a quick glance and a "You look nice."
Flat.
Safe.
Careful.
The restaurant was beautiful — old wood, thick curtains, etched glass, glamour from another century. We'd booked a table at the back to avoid too much attention. She took the seat with her back to the room. I let her. I always did.
From the outside, we looked perfect.
An elegant couple, dressed for seduction and celebration.
But I felt the distance in her from the moment the menus arrived.
She was polite.
She asked questions about the wine.
She smiled at the waiter.
But her eyes never held mine long.
The shame tanks were filling again.
Even tucked away, even in a foreign city where no one knew us, she felt the pressure. The eyes. The whispers she imagined. The judgment that haunted her.
A 25-year-old Black goddess.
With a white man old enough to be her grandfather.
Even here. Even now.
It was too much.
She didn't say it out loud.
She never did.
But her silence said it all.
That ache of being seen — not as a lover, but as a paradox.
She picked at her food. I made conversation with the air.
She said she was tired.
I said I understood.
And the space between us widened like a fault line nobody had mapped.
By dessert, we both knew this wasn't the dinner we'd imagined.
Not a birthday celebration.
Not a romantic escape.
Just two beautiful people in beautiful clothes, pretending they hadn't already lost something essential in the noise of other people's opinions.
When we left, she took my arm.
But her hand felt like it was holding on for balance, not affection.
And I knew, deep down, that I hadn't brought her here to impress her.
I'd brought her here to try and find the version of her I was already beginning to lose.

## Red Lace and Bomber Love

We didn't speak much on the Uber back.

She held my hand, but loosely. The kind of hold that could slip away with one wrong sentence.

At the hotel, she disappeared into the bathroom.

Water ran. Silence. The shuffle of fabric.

I sat scrolling through photos from Seville, wondering if the night was over — or about to begin again.

The door opened.

She stepped out in that stunning red Victoria's Secret set — skimpy triangle of satin stretched over her breasts, panties barely hanging onto her hips.

And over it — my black bomber jacket. Unzipped. Heavy. Masculine.

She walked toward me slowly, deliberately, to a Beyoncé song.

No smile. No words. Just heat.

The jacket hung low on her shoulders, more draped than worn. Her heels clicked against the laminate floor.

She stopped at my feet, cocked one hip, tilted her head — like she was deciding whether to give me mercy or punishment.

Then she turned up the music.

Beyoncé… *Sweet Dreams*. Or a Beautiful Nightmare.

How prophetic.

And she danced.

Not like a performance. Not like a TikTok tease. Like a woman reclaiming her fire.

She ran her hands through her hair… down the inside of her thighs… across her belly. She turned and bent — just enough to make me groan.

Then she faced me again and slipped the bomber jacket from her shoulders.

I reached for her. She shook her head.

"No. Not yet."

So I waited.

I waited while she let herself feel desired again. Let herself remember she was a goddess. Let herself choose me.

And when she finally climbed across my lap — over me, onto me — there was no distance left. No shame. No judgment.

Just her hips grinding into mine, her breath catching, her voice breaking as I pulled her panties aside and slid inside her.

Then we moved to the bed.

She came quickly. Then again. And again.

Her hands gripped my shoulders like she was trying to hold the world still.

I didn't care if we broke the bed. I didn't care if we screamed loud enough for the neighbours.

I only cared that, for this one night, I had her back.

Not the surface version. Not the careful girl from the restaurant.

But the woman who chose me when everything said she shouldn't.

We fell asleep wrapped around each other, the bomber jacket half-draped across her hips like a flag planted in foreign territory.

And I remember thinking — maybe we were still alive.

## The Ticket Scam and Sierra Escape

We woke late. She stretched beside me, tangled in sheets and shadows, and for a moment, we were in sync again.

Until the email.

She sat up suddenly, phone in hand, brows knitting. "These Alhambra tickets… I think they're fake."

They were. Scammed, like thousands of other tourists. The website had looked official.

She was furious. Not loud-furious. Cold-furious. That quiet, clenched-jaw rage that simmered beneath perfect skin.

For the next hour, she scrolled, tapped, messaged. Found a real agent. Called. Waited.

Finally — success. Yes, there were tickets. Yes, for Sunday afternoon. Yes… very expensive.

She clicked buy without looking at me. "Done. We're going."

Our Saturday plan flipped. No palace. No walking tour.

We got in the car and drove to the Sierra Nevada.

The road twisted through hills and pine forest, climbing toward snow. She wore leggings and a loose top. No makeup again. Cat-girl mode — windows down, hair blowing, sunglasses too big for her face.

We played music. Talked shit. Took photos at random pull-offs.

She climbed a rock and posed like a fashion shoot.

"You look like a snow goddess in exile."

"You're getting soft."

"Only for you."

And for a couple of hours, we were easy again. Not couple-easy. Not future-easy. But two people who could still make each other laugh.

Two bodies in a car trying to outrun a scam, a fight, a city, a history.

Back at the hotel, we showered. Separately.

She lay on the bed afterward, scrolling Instagram. I sat by the window.

"Big dinner tonight," she said. Voice soft now. "Get ready, birthday boy."

And we started to prepare — for a night that neither of us knew would end in fire.

## Birthday Dinner and Champagne Tension

She chose the dress carefully — semi-sheer cascade of soft oranges and pinks, her black leather jacket over it. Armour.

I wore the blue suit with white T-shirt. Her suggestion. Younger.

Mirror selfies in the hotel bathroom. Smiles that looked real enough.

The restaurant — a vintage railway carriage, converted fine-dining. Starched tablecloths, menu that wants you to ask questions.

The moment we walked in, her energy dropped.

Middle-aged couples. Men in polos. Frozen smiles. Hushed conversations.

It smelled like asparagus and quiet judgment.

We sat by the window. Good view. Bad vibe.

She sat stiffly. Didn't take off her jacket. Didn't order wine.

I ordered champagne anyway.

She took one polite sip and left the rest.

Between courses, we watched an older man feed his wife with a fork — this tender, mechanical gesture that felt both sweet and desperately lonely.

I held her hand across the table.

She let me.

But her fingers didn't squeeze back.

By dessert, the champagne was warm and flat.

"This place is too much," she finally said.

I didn't argue.

We paid. Left. Drove back in silence.

And I knew — whatever magic we'd made in that hotel room was already fading.

## Midnight Meltdown

I don't remember what triggered it.

But suddenly she was quiet. Cold. Distant.

And I erupted.

"You've been pulling away all night."

She said nothing.

"I've done everything I can. I brought you here. I tried."

Still nothing.

"Say something."

She sat on the edge of the bed, back to me, shoulders tight.

"You don't get it," she finally said. Voice flat. "You never do."

"Then help me get it."

She turned. Looked at me with eyes full of something I didn't want to name.

"You can't fix this. You can't fix *me*."

I felt my chest tighten.

"I'm not trying to fix you."

"Yes, you are. You always are."

Her words hung in the air like smoke.

I tried to soften. Reach for her hand.

She pulled away.

"I need space."

"Space? We're in Granada for your birthday—"

"I didn't ask for this!" she snapped. "I didn't ask for any of this."

That landed like a slap.

We stared at each other — two people who'd come here hoping to reclaim something, only to discover it was already gone.

I grabbed my jacket. Walked out.

Wandered Granada's empty streets until 2 a.m., smoking cigarettes I'd bummed from strangers, trying to figure out how we'd gotten here.

When I came back, she was asleep.

Or pretending.

I lay on the far side of the bed.

We didn't touch.

## 4AM Resurrection
I don't know what time it was exactly.
Maybe four. Maybe later.
But I felt her before I saw her.
The sheet slipped from my chest.
Her body pressed against mine — not accidentally.
Hips nudging. Mouth brushing my neck.
Hands moving with intention.
I opened my eyes.
She was already on top of me.
Kissing my face. My neck. My lips.
No words. Just heat.
I was half-awake, fully hard.
Surprised how quickly my body reacted,
how quickly the fury gave way to instinct.
She rubbed against me like she was trying to erase the night.
Her breath hot. Movements urgent.
And then she paused.
"I lied," she whispered.
"Irish isn't coming."
I stayed quiet.
"I called him. I was angry. He offered to come get me."
Her voice broke a little.
"But I said no."
I looked at her — really looked.
Eyes wide and haunted. Body trembling slightly.
"I wanted to hurt you," she said.
"Like you've hurt me."
And then she kissed me again.
Deeper. Harder.
Like a woman trying to reclaim something that was already slipping.
I pulled her panties aside and slid inside her.
She gasped.
And everything else dissolved.
She rode me hard.
Desperate. Wild.
Like she was trying to fuck the demons out of both of us.
She came fast.
Then again.
Moaning, breaking, clinging to my chest like she didn't know how to stop.
Then she pulled me to the bathroom.
Bent over the counter.
I took her from behind,
and that's when it happened —
the flood.
She squirted again and again.
Soaking the floor. The tiles. My thighs.
Collapsing forward as I held her hips and kept moving.
It was the kind of sex you don't recover from.
Not that night. Not for days.
The kind that doesn't erase the pain —
but makes it irrelevant.
For an hour.
We showered together, finally.
Washed each other without speaking.
Laid down, wet hair on wet skin, and drifted into the kind of sleep only lovers and fighters earn.
And in that moment —
wrapped in towels, sweat, and silence —
I thought maybe we were still possible.
Or at least not entirely broken.
Not yet.

## The Alhambra Distance
We woke late.
Maybe 11.
There were no more orgasms. No morning kisses. No lingering warmth.
Just a quiet, exhausted peace.
The kind you feel after a storm — when the wreckage hasn't been cleared, but at least the wind has stopped.
We dressed slowly.
She wore something casual. I don't remember what.
My mind was still replaying the night — her leaving, her return, the madness in between.
We were supposed to meet the tour group at the Alhambra Palace.
Or so we thought.
We drove up the winding road, parked near the old fortress gates.
No one there.
Just confused tourists and two guards giving vague directions.
Eventually, we realised our mistake.
The meeting point was downtown.
We were in the wrong place.
A small panic followed — rushing back into the car, checking our tickets, searching GPS links, messaging the agency.
We made it just in time.
Slipped into the group just before they entered the grounds.
There were maybe twenty of us.
All ages. All nationalities.
An English family. A middle-aged French couple. Two backpacking Germans with matching tattoos.
And us.
Or maybe just me.
Because Julia… drifted.
She didn't walk beside me.
She stayed near, but not with me.
Always a few steps ahead or behind.
As if she were touring alone.
And maybe she was.
The guide led us through the military section of the palace first.
Stone towers. Guard quarters. Ruins overlooking the hills.
It was impressive, in theory. But something felt flat.
Even the gardens in that section — once majestic, now tired.
Overgrown. Underwhelming.
But then we crossed into the second part.
And the beauty returned.
Delicate carvings. Flowing fountains. Rose-lined pathways.
The kind of place where history whispers instead of shouts.
The kind of place you want to share with someone you love.
But still, she kept her distance.
Stopped to take photos on her own.
Lingered in corners.
Bent to smell flowers I wasn't invited to witness.
When I tried to catch her gaze, she looked past me.
Not cruelly.
Just… elsewhere.
Her shame tanks were filling again.
Not violently.
Quietly.
The whispers in her head louder than any guide.
The age gap.
The tourists.
The people who might wonder what she was doing here — with me.
Every now and then, she reached for my hand.
Briefly. Lightly.
But it never lasted.
We walked for three hours.
Through sunlight and shadow.
Through beauty and silence.
And by the end, I felt more alone than I had the night before — even with her body wrapped around mine.

## Epilogue – The Long Road Home
We didn't go out that Sunday night.
I don't even remember if we ate.
Nothing memorable happened.
No fights. No sex. No moments worth marking.
Just fatigue.
The kind that seeps into your bones after too many emotional miles.
We packed in silence the next morning.
She folded her clothes methodically, humming under her breath.
I loaded the car. Checked the GPS. Said something about rain.
It was pouring before we even left Granada.
Thick, grey, unrelenting rain.
The kind that muffles everything — even thoughts.
She curled up in the passenger seat, hoodie pulled over her head.
Within half an hour, she was asleep.
And she stayed asleep.
For hours.
I drove in silence.
Wipers clicking.
Road slick.
Mind spinning.
There was no music.
No road trip playlist.
No selfies or side glances.
Just me, the rain, and a growing knot in my chest.
I thought about the weekend —
The fight.
The lie.
The sex.
The tour.
The distance.
How we'd danced at the edge of everything — love, rage, shame, pleasure — but never quite crossed into peace.
It had been my birthday.
My seventy-third.
And I didn't feel old.
I felt… hollow.
Like I'd just lived through the trailer for a much sadder film.
A preview of what was coming.
Of how this story might really end.
She stirred once, maybe twice. Mumbled something I didn't catch.
Then drifted again.
And I kept driving.
Through the storm.
Through the silence.
Back toward Lisbon.
Back toward the slow unraveling we were both pretending hadn't already begun.
Little did I know this was only the opening tremor —
A quiet rehearsal for the mountain highs and crashing lows still to come:
My mother's stroke. Her slow, aching exit from life.
And that fateful cruise from Venice to Mykonos, Santorini, and back again —
The trip that would give Julia everything… and take everything from me.
