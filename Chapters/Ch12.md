# Chapter 12: Before Granada

## Scene 1: Post-New Year Drift

After Christmas Eve, we tried to pretend.

That we were a family of two. That something whole still held us together. That the cracks from Ayia Napa and the makeup on my sheets and all the men who'd come between us were just surface damage.

But truthfully, something fragile had already cracked.

And with the first champagne pop of New Year's Eve, it began to split wide open.

She wasn't with me that night.

She was at a hotel in central Lisbon, celebrating with her family. Her mother. Her sisters. Cousins. The whole Portuguese Catholic clan, dressed up, toasting the new year with sparkling wine and forced optimism.

I was alone.

In my house in Cascais, the industrial bachelor pad with too much space and too little warmth. I sat on the couch with a bottle of Douro red, scrolling through old photos of us on my phone. Julia laughing. Julia naked. Julia straddling me on this same couch, eyes wild, hair everywhere.

George Michael played on my speakers. "Careless Whisper." Then "A Different Corner." Songs that sounded like loneliness set to saxophone.

At midnight, fireworks exploded over the Tagus. I could see them from my terrace, distant and colorful and irrelevant.

My phone buzzed.

Julia.

"Happy New Year… to my fav person."

I stared at the message for a long time.

My favorite person.

But she wasn't here.

I replied warmly. "Happy New Year, beautiful. Miss you."

But I felt the absence more than the words. We weren't together. And that absence — that empty space where she should have been — felt louder than any fireworks.

I felt her slipping even as she messaged me.

Like fingers slowly sliding apart two minutes into my morning vertical hang from the pull-up bar over my front door. That moment when your grip weakens and you know — you absolutely know — you're about to fall. But you can't stop it.

We saw each other a few days later.

She came over on a grey January afternoon. The kind of day where Lisbon's usual sunshine hides behind fog and the Atlantic breeze feels less romantic, more punishing.

She looked tired. Beautiful, but tired. Dark circles under her eyes. Lips chapped and cracked from the cold. She'd been sick — a sore throat, a cough that wouldn't quit.

I held her. Kissed her forehead. Led her to the couch.

We didn't talk much. Just sat there, my arm around her, her head on my shoulder, pretending everything was fine.

Eventually, we moved to the bedroom.

We had sex.

Soft, careful sex. The kind where you're more worried about breaking something than building anything.

I was on top of her, moving slowly, watching her face. Her eyes were open, but distant. Somewhere else. Her hands rested on my back, but there was no urgency, no grip, no need.

She wasn't present.

And I knew it.

When it was over, we lay there in silence. She stared at the ceiling. I stared at her.

"You okay?" I asked.

She didn't answer right away.

"I'm just tired," she finally said.

And tired became her word for January.

Tired from family.

Tired from the cold — and the colds, the sore throats that clung to her like fog.

Tired of her cracked lips that bled when she smiled.

Tired from university. Exams. Essays. Pressure.

Tired from us.

Sometimes she cried.

Silently, but with tears that curled down her cheek like whispers I wasn't allowed to hear.

I'd ask what was wrong. She'd shake her head. Say nothing. Or say everything was fine when it clearly wasn't.

Sometimes she went out with friends and came back late, smelling like cigarettes and wine, eyes red from crying or laughing or both.

Sometimes she disappeared altogether. Wouldn't answer my texts for hours. Then she'd resurface with a simple "Sorry, was busy" and no explanation.

Other nights, she came to me.

Curling up in my arms like a girl seeking shelter from a storm only she could see.

One night, she kissed my beard and whispered, "I miss your smell."

Another night, she stood naked at the bathroom door, her lip cracked and bleeding, mascara smudged under her eyes, and said:

"I don't know why I'm so emotional all the time. Like my heart keeps spinning and I don't know which direction is home."

I didn't have an answer.

Because I didn't know either.

Meanwhile, Irish kept resurfacing.

She didn't hide it anymore. His name came up in casual conversation. She'd mention him in passing — "Irish texted me today" or "Irish is back from Australia."

Sometimes she rolled her eyes when his name came up, like he was an annoying mosquito she couldn't swat away.

Other times, she defended him.

"He's still trying," she said once. "But I don't want him."

I didn't believe her.

Not completely.

Not anymore.

One Sunday afternoon, she arrived at my place, walked straight to the couch, and curled up with her coat still on.

"Can we not talk today?" she said quietly. "I'm just… overwhelmed."

I made her tea. Camomile. The kind she liked when she was anxious.

I kissed her forehead. Tucked a blanket around her. Sat beside her in silence.

She fell asleep like that. Coat on. Tea untouched.

And I watched her breathe.

Slow. Fragile. Lost.

But each time she left — each time she walked out my door and disappeared into her chaotic life — the silence grew louder.

And I knew.

We were slipping.

## Scene 2: The Saturday Night Cancellation and Irish's Rise

We were supposed to go out that Saturday night.

I'd planned it carefully. Reserved a rooftop table at Solar dos Presuntos — the place she'd once said she loved. Soft lighting. A view of the Tagus curling through the city. Elegant enough to feel special, but relaxed enough that she could wear heels without overthinking it.

I even prepared myself that afternoon.

Shaved. Trimmed my beard with extra care, shaping it the way she liked. I picked out the grey jacket she'd once told me made me look like "a professor who might also be dangerous in bed." Sprayed on the Tom Ford cologne she used to bury her nose in.

I was trying.

Trying to win her back. Trying to remind her of who we used to be.

But at 6pm, my phone buzzed.

"Sorry baby… I'm just really tired. Don't be mad. Please."

Tired again.

I stared at the message for a long moment. The grey jacket hanging on the back of my chair. The reservation confirmed. The cologne already fading on my skin.

I wanted to be angry. But all I felt was hollow.

I texted back: "It's okay. Rest. We'll do it another time."

But I knew.

Something was wrong.

She was offbeat. Even in her texts. Short replies. Long delays. Sentences that trailed off into nothing.

I asked if she was with someone.

"No."

But I felt the shadow of someone else.

It was Irish again.

He'd come back from Australia a few weeks earlier. Determined. Bearing little gifts — flowers, a necklace, some book she'd mentioned months ago that he'd somehow remembered. He was circling her again, patient and persistent, like a wolf waiting for the wounded deer to separate from the herd.

She claimed she hadn't seen him.

"Not yet, anyway."

But there was a pull in her words. A gravity shifting back in his direction.

I asked her if she missed him.

She paused. A long pause. The kind that means the answer is yes, but she doesn't want to say it.

"Not really," she finally typed. "I just want peace."

But peace had a cost.

And so did indecision.

The next few days, she drifted further. Not cold, exactly, but unreachable. Like I was yelling through thick glass and she could see my lips moving but couldn't hear a word.

And somewhere behind that glass, Irish was waiting.

Warm. Available. Uncomplicated.

Less demanding. Less broken. Younger.

Everything I wasn't anymore.

When I finally asked again — really asked, voice to voice, no hiding behind texts — if there was something going on with him, she said:

"He invited me for dinner."

My chest tightened.

"And?"

"I said maybe."

Maybe.

That word sat between us like a grenade with the pin half-pulled.


## Scene 3: Galentine's Part One: Hillary and the Pretend Lesbians

It was February 13th. Galentine's Day. The night before Valentine's.

I didn't see her.

She was with Hillary, her closest girlfriend. The one who knew everything. The one who'd heard all the stories about us, about Irish, about the mess Julia's heart had become.

They'd planned a Galentine's dinner weeks earlier. Just the two of them. Wine and sushi at some trendy spot in Chiado. Laughter. Selfies. Soul time.

I remember thinking how much she needed that night. Girl time. Something innocent. Something that didn't involve men and their damage.

But it wasn't just innocent.

She told me later — laughing, eyes sparkling — that they'd pretended to be a lesbian couple for the restaurant staff.

Held hands across the table.

Played with eye contact. Long, flirtatious stares that made the waitress blush.

They even kissed once. Brief. Theatrical. Playful.

The waitress didn't know what to do. She hovered awkwardly, confused but charmed, probably wondering if she should bring one check or two.

Julia loved it.

The performance. The rebellion. The quiet thrill of being untouchable for one night. Loved without being hunted. Desired without being consumed.

She messaged me around 11pm.

Photos of their sushi. A mirror selfie from the bathroom — both of them laughing, Hillary's tongue sticking out, Julia's eyes alive again.

She looked happy.

Or at least… occupied.

And I was alone.

Sitting on my couch in Cascais. George Michael on repeat.

Again.

## Scene 4: Galentine's Part Two: The Angolan Girls and the 2AM Tears

The next night — Valentine's Day itself — was louder.

Julia had booked a hotel suite in central Lisbon with a few old friends from Angola. Girls she'd grown up with. Wild, beautiful, untamed women who laughed too loud and drank too much and didn't apologize for any of it.

They dressed up.

Poured cheap champagne into plastic cups.

Filmed TikToks in the bathroom mirror, pouting and posing like they were in a music video.

Talked shit about men.

Said they didn't need any of us.

Tried to reclaim something.

She'd warned me in advance.

"Girl sleepover. No boys allowed."

I said, "Have fun."

But I meant, "Don't disappear."

Around midnight, she sent me a short video.

Her in silk shorts and a crop top. Laughing on the bed, hair wild and tangled. Eyes glassy from champagne. Music thumping in the background.

She looked free.

Then silence.

No messages. No updates.

Just silence.

The next morning, I woke up to a text.

"All my friends asked me why I was crying."

I sat up in bed, staring at my phone.

"What happened?" I wrote back.

She didn't answer right away.

When she finally did, the story came out in fragments.

It had been around 2 a.m. They were lying on hotel beds in matching white robes, sipping wine, coming down from the high of the night. Someone started joking about exes. About fake relationships. About Valentine's drama.

And then one of the girls — softly, carefully, sensing something fragile in Julia — asked:

"But why don't you celebrate Valentine's with your man?"

Julia froze.

She didn't know how to answer. Or maybe she did, but didn't want to say it out loud.

"I just said... it's complicated."

But that wasn't enough. They pressed. Gently. Lovingly. The way close friends do when they sense you're drowning.

So she told them.

Not everything. Not the full story. But enough.

She told them about the makeup on my sheets. About Aline. About how I'd betrayed the monogamy we'd promised each other.

She didn't mention Ayia Napa. Or the men she'd fucked in revenge. Or the fact that we were both guilty.

She just told them her side.

And they said what friends always say:

"You don't deserve this. You're too good for him."

And that's when she started crying.

Lying in that hotel bed, surrounded by women who both adored her and envied her, she cried.

Not because she was angry at me.

But because the anger she wanted to feel was tangled in something deeper. Something she couldn't cut free.

She still loved me.

She cried because I had been her Valentine for the past two years. And now someone else had been in my bed.

She cried because despite everything — despite the betrayal, the hurt, the chaos — she hadn't stopped texting me.

Hadn't stopped hoping.

Hadn't stopped loving.

When she told me this, I didn't know what to say.

She'd gone out dressed like a woman who was free. Sparkly top. Perfect makeup. Head held high.

But she came back haunted.

"Don't worry," she said. "Just emotions. I'm tired."

Tired again.

But now I knew what that meant.

## Scene 5: The Sunday Seduction and the Serbian Who Didn't

The day after the hotel sleepover, she went dancing.

It was Sunday night. She said it was casual. Just her, two girlfriends, and some guy from uni.

A small bar in Bairro Alto. Late drinks. Afrobeat pulsing through the speakers.

She told me not to worry.

I worried anyway.

Around midnight, she texted: "Still out."

I asked, "With Irish?"

"No."

Then silence.

The next morning, she filled in the blanks.

There'd been a Serbian guy at the bar.

Tall. Hot. But shy.

She noticed him first. Standing awkwardly near the bar, nursing a beer, stealing glances at her.

She smiled at him. Held his gaze a little too long.

He didn't move. Too nervous. So his friend came over instead, playing wingman.

"He thinks you're beautiful," the friend said.

Julia didn't wait.

"Tell him to come talk to me."

He did.

By then, her girlfriends had left. It was just the two of them in a half-lit bar, bass thumping, bodies swaying, the air thick with heat and possibility.

They talked. Flirted. Laughed for forty minutes.

He was sweet. Careful. Interested.

When the bar closed, he called her an Uber.

And she went home.

Alone.

She told me later she'd thought about it. Really thought about it.

Fucking him.

Right there. Right then.

"I almost did," she said. "But I knew I'd regret it in the morning."

I didn't know how to feel.

Proud? Jealous? Relieved?

What stuck with me wasn't that she didn't.

It was that she could have.

Easily.

She had that power. That magnetic gravity that pulled men into her orbit and made them forget everything else.

And on nights like that — when she was high on freedom and heartbreak and cheap champagne — even I wasn't sure what tethered her to me anymore.


## Scene 6: Breakups, Crossroads, and the Irish Confession

Late February was a mess of contradictions.

She was tired again. Not just physically. Emotionally brittle. Fragile in her eyes. Sharp in her texts.

Some days she wanted to see me. Would show up at my door unannounced, curl into my arms, kiss my neck, tell me she missed me.

Other days she didn't reply to my messages at all. Left me on read. Disappeared into her own chaos.

Some days she sent long, soulful messages. Paragraphs about her confusion, her pain, her love for me tangled up in anger.

Other days: dry monosyllables. "K." "Fine." "Busy."

She was still talking to Irish. Still weighing something.

"He says he misses me," she told me one night on the phone.

I could hear the hesitation in her voice.

"He wants to try again. Says he's changed. That he's ready now."

I stayed quiet.

"But I don't know," she continued. "I feel... nothing. When I think about him."

I didn't push. Didn't ask questions. Didn't demand she choose.

I'd already lost the right to demand anything.

But then, out of nowhere, she called me.

It was late. Past midnight. Her voice was low, ragged. She'd been crying.

"Steve..."

"What happened?"

She took a breath. A shaky, wine-soaked breath.

"He asked me to come over. Irish. We were drinking. I was at a bar with friends and he texted and I... I said yes."

My chest tightened.

"I wanted to fuck him," she confessed. "I was drunk. Angry. I needed to feel wanted. Needed to prove something to myself. I don't even know what."

I said nothing. Just listened.

"But when I got to his place..."

She paused.

"I called him by your name."

Silence.

"I said 'Steve'... and he froze. Just stood there, staring at me like I'd slapped him."

I closed my eyes.

"What did he do?"

"He pulled away. Told me I was too drunk. That it wasn't right. That maybe I didn't really want him at all."

Her voice broke.

"And he was right. I didn't. I don't."

She stayed anyway. Too drunk to leave. Too tired to argue.

He was drunk too.

So they just slept. Together, but untouched. Like two wounded animals seeking warmth but unable to trust each other enough to heal.

And she was sad.

Not because Irish hadn't fucked her.

But because even drunk, even angry, even in another man's bed — her heart still reached for me.

"I don't know what's wrong with me," she whispered.

"I can't let go."

I wanted to say: Neither can I.

But I didn't.

Because saying it out loud would make it real. Would make the pain sharper. Would force us to decide.

So we didn't run back to each other.

We circled. We drifted.

Waiting for something. An excuse. A sign. A collision.

And Granada was already waiting on the horizon.

## Scene 7: The Texts That Nearly Cancelled Granada

Two weeks before Granada, everything almost broke again.

It started on a Tuesday afternoon.

I was at home, working on my laptop, when her message came through.

"I do love you but I'm trying to not get too attached."

I stared at the screen.

What the fuck did that mean?

I replied carefully. Cautiously.

"There's a big difference between not getting too attached and protecting yourself..."

I hesitated. Then added:

"If you want, we can change the emphasis of our relationship. Make it more casual. Less intense."

I was trying to give her space. Trying to protect her from me. From us.

But her response came fast. Too fast.

"If that's what you want… okay."

My stomach dropped.

No.

That wasn't what I wanted. But I thought it was what she needed. I thought I was doing the right thing.

"It's not what I want," I typed quickly. "But I think it's what you need right now. To have less pressure. Less expectation."

She replied:

"Okay Steve. I don't want to stress. So it's fine."

And then came the dagger.

"So we're not going anymore to Granada?"

I froze.

What?

"No!" I wrote back immediately. "I still wanna go to Granada. And have some real fun together."

I was scrambling now. Trying to salvage it. Reframe it. Pull us back from the edge.

"And maybe you visiting here — but not going to bed or staying overnight — will get some of the troubling images out of your head."

I meant the images of Aline. Of my betrayal. The makeup on the sheets.

But she wasn't done.

"No one is acting like friends here."

My chest tightened.

"We are what we are and that's it."

"I need space to forget what happened."

"But I'm fine with you. Just don't want to think about it."

I sat there, staring at my phone, reading and rereading her messages.

What do you say to that?

How do you hold someone who's trying to erase you — gently?

How do you fight for someone without pushing them further away?

I didn't beg.

I didn't blame.

I didn't try to convince her or defend myself or explain.

I just wrote:

"Ok. Good."

That was all I could offer.

Two words. A surrender disguised as acceptance.

But inside, I felt it.

The edge.

We were standing on the edge of something final. One more misstep — one more wrong word, one more failed attempt at connection — and she'd fall away completely.

We weren't broken.

Not yet.

But we were cracked.

Fragile.

Held together by nothing more than inertia and the faint, desperate hope that Granada might save us.

And so we packed.

Separately. Silently.

Both of us pretending we believed it would work.

## Scene 8: Danish, the Apartment, and the Proposal

While Irish faded into the fog of her past, another man stepped forward with unsettling clarity.

Danish.

Older. Wealthy. Well-groomed in that European way that suggested old money and quiet power. Tailored suits. Expensive watches. A BMW that purred instead of roared.

The kind of man who didn't chase women.

He negotiated for them.

They'd met months earlier at some upscale networking event Julia had attended for her university program. He was a consultant. Or maybe in finance. She'd never been entirely clear. But he had money. Real money. The kind that doesn't need to be loud.

And now he was circling again.

She told me about it one night over the phone. Casual. Almost too casual.

"Danish wants to meet for coffee."

"Okay," I said. "What does he want?"

She hesitated.

"He has... a proposal."

The next day, she met him at a café in Chiado. Expensive espresso. Polished marble tables. Men in suits discussing deals that would never include people like me.

He didn't waste time.

"I want to offer you something," he said.

She sipped her coffee. Waited.

"An apartment."

She blinked.

"What?"

"I own a beautiful apartment in Lisbon. Two bedrooms. Fully furnished. Excellent location. It's sitting empty. I want you to have it."

Julia stared at him.

"Why?"

He smiled. Calm. Confident.

"Because I like you. And I think you deserve your own space. Independence. Freedom from... complications."

She knew what he meant.

Freedom from me. From Irish. From the chaos of her current life.

"What's the catch?" she asked.

He leaned back, hands folded.

"Whenever I'm in town — which is maybe once or twice a month — I want to sleep with you."

There it was.

No relationship. No romance. Just access.

She sat there, processing.

"So you want me to be... what? Available?"

"I want you to be comfortable," he corrected. "The apartment is yours. I'll cover everything. Rent. Bills. Furniture. You just... make time for me when I'm here."

She shook her head.

"No."

He didn't flinch. Didn't look surprised.

"Fair enough."

But he wasn't done.

A week later, he called her again.

"I've been thinking," he said. "What if I make it exclusive?"

"What do you mean?"

"The apartment. Everything I offered. But exclusive. You'd be with me, and only me. I'd take care of you completely. Financially. Emotionally. You'd never have to worry about anything again."

She was silent for a long moment.

"You're asking me to be your... kept woman?"

"I'm asking you to be my partner. In a practical sense."

"But not love."

He paused.

"Love complicates things. I'm offering you stability. Security. Peace."

She thought about it. Really thought about it.

She told me later — lying in my arms, staring at the ceiling — that for a moment, she was tempted.

"I'm so tired, Steve," she whispered. "Tired of drama. Tired of being pulled in ten directions. Tired of not knowing if you and I are going to survive another week."

I said nothing. Just held her.

"And he's offering... quiet. Ease. A life where I don't have to fight for anything."

"But no love," I said.

"But no pain, either."

She said no to him again.

But Danish wasn't finished.

The final card came two weeks before Granada.

He invited her to dinner. A Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking the Tagus. Wine that cost more than my monthly rent.

And over dessert, he said it.

"Marry me."

Julia nearly choked on her wine.

"What?"

"Marry me. Come to Switzerland. I'll show you a different life. Stability. Comfort. Respect. You'll never have to struggle again."

She stared at him, speechless.

"I'm serious," he continued. "I know this seems sudden. But I've thought about it. You're intelligent. Beautiful. Ambitious. You deserve better than what you have now."

Better than me, he meant.

"And what would I have to give up?" she asked quietly.

"Nothing that's truly serving you."

She didn't answer him that night.

She came to me instead.

Showed up at my door, late, eyes red from crying or thinking or both.

"He asked me to marry him," she said.

I felt my chest tighten.

"What did you say?"

"I didn't say anything. I just... left."

She collapsed onto my couch. I sat beside her.

"Do you want to?" I asked. Even though I didn't want to know the answer.

She was quiet for a long time.

"Part of me does," she finally admitted. "The part that's exhausted. The part that wants to stop fighting. To stop hurting."

"And the other part?"

She looked at me.

"The other part knows I'd be miserable. Because I don't love him. And I'd spend the rest of my life wondering what we could have been."

She reached for my hand.

"I told him I wanted love. Not a contract. Not safety. Not money."

"And what did he say?"

"He said love is overrated. That passion fades. That what I'm chasing with you will burn out and leave me with nothing."

I didn't know what to say.

Because maybe he was right.

"But I can't," she whispered. "I can't choose the easy thing. Not yet."

She said she wasn't tempted.

But I knew better.

I knew how fragile she felt. How easily safety can seduce, especially when your heart is tired of chasing magic.

I didn't fight.

What right did I have?

She'd been offered everything.

An apartment. Security. Exclusivity. Marriage. A whole new life, polished and perfect and painless.

And I—

I was still healing from being her everything, then her nothing.

And somewhere between Irish's faded echo and Danish's dazzling offer, we both started packing for Granada.

Hoping that three days in Spain could somehow save what we'd spent a year destroying.
