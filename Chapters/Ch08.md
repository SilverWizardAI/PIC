# Chapter 8: Erotic Fantasy Weekend

## Leverage

I used to think betrayal had a clean edge. A sudden rip. A painful scream. But sometimes, it creeps in like silk. And smells like her perfume.

After Aline, I expected anger. Silence. Maybe exile. What I got instead… was a text. "Hey. Can I see you?"

Just six words. No emojis. No hints. But I knew that tone. It wasn't affection. It was leverage.

I said yes, of course. Because guilt is powerful. And Julia knew exactly how to slide back in.

She arrived like nothing had changed. Lip gloss shimmering, a loose white tee, no bra — just enough to remind me of the nipples that used to ache for my touch. I could see them through the thin fabric, darker circles beneath white cotton, shifting as she moved. She kissed me. Lightly. Sweetly. Her mouth tasted like mint and something sharper — vodka, maybe, or just the bite of her intention. Then she sat on the couch and curled her legs under herself like she'd never left.

But the way she curled her legs told me: this wasn't tenderness. It was strategy. Every movement calculated. The tee riding up just enough to show the curve of her hip. Her eyes scanning my apartment like she was inventorying what still belonged to her. What she could still take.

"So… do you want to make up for how you hurt me being unfaithful with Aline?"

It wasn't a question. It was bait. And I bit.

I offered her a glass of wine, tried to smile like we were friends again. My hands shook pouring it. She noticed. She always noticed. But she didn't want wine. She wanted something else.

She leaned in — close enough that I could smell her skin, that specific mix of vanilla and sweat that used to drive me insane — and said, "I want to go to Ayia Napa. But I need your help."

She explained the plan — a girls' week away, a break, a reset. Her eyes glinted with something else. Curiosity? Danger? Revenge? I didn't ask. I just opened my wallet. Because that's what donkeys do… even when they hate themselves for doing it. Even when they know they're being played. Even when the humiliation burns hotter than the betrayal ever did.

But before Ayia Napa, I encouraged something else. I told her to give Bouquet a chance. Not just flowers and rooftop dates. But a real chance — to hold her, to please her, to show her he wasn't just a soft-souled banker in a sports car.

I said, "Let him try. You like him. He really cares for you. Much better than all your other lovers. He might not have a big dick. You even think he has a wimpy dick, but you have never really given him a good opportunity. You had your period during the Amalfi trip and he was not like the Greek. He was too much of a gentleman — and probably too embarrassed — to fuck you when you were bleeding. So give him a real chance. Let him prove he can handle you… all of you. Let him fuck you… and see if he can make you come!"

She laughed. "You really sure?" I nodded. "Better for you to find out now than keep wondering if he could be your future."

And, boy… did she take my advice. Though I knew nothing of it till a few days after it happened. Which was also a few days before she left for 8 days in Ayia Napa. The week when she was crowned the Queen of Ayia Napa. But it was the weekend before when Bouquet got his chance to gorge himself on Julia's Black Forest Erotic Layer Cake… and gorge he did.

A few days after the best weekend of Bouquet's life, one he could only have dreamed of, I received the following text from Julia: "So… do you want to hear what happened on the weekend with Bouquet?" Just like before… It wasn't a question. It was bait. And I bit… hard.

So she came and crushed me before Ayia Napa crushed me even more. This was her story…

## Friday: The Green Dress and Sky Bar

She found the dress at Vasco da Gama. A short, wicked green thing that stopped just below her pussy and clung to her breasts like it had been stitched directly onto her skin. Off-the-shoulder, backless, and cut to kill. Tits out. Legs bare. No bra. No panties.

The fabric was some kind of miracle — thin enough to show the shape of her nipples when they hardened, tight enough to make every curve a weapon. She tried it on in the fitting room and knew immediately. This wasn't a dress. This was a declaration.

When Bouquet saw it, his mouth dropped open like he'd won a private lottery. She gave him a twirl outside the fitting room, the hem riding up dangerously high. "Too much?" she teased. He couldn't even speak. Just shook his head, eyes glassy, already imagining the night ahead.

Later, when he picked her up for dinner, she answered the door in that green dress and strappy heels that made her legs go on forever. She opened the car door, slid in, and whispered, "Guess what I'm not wearing." He almost crashed pulling out of the parking spot.

At the Tivoli Avenida, the restaurant went quiet when they walked in. Just for a second. Just long enough for every head to turn. The waiters could barely keep their trays balanced. One nearly dropped a bottle of wine, eyes locked on the way her breasts moved beneath the green fabric. Heads turned. Necks craned. Men stared openly, some nudging their dates to look, others trying and failing to be discreet. Women bristled, whispering behind menus, adjusting their own dresses like they could compete.

And Bouquet? He was glowing. Horny. Proud. Possessive. Drunk on her beauty and the fact that she was his. Even just for the weekend. He kept touching her hand across the table, his thumb tracing circles on her wrist like he was staking his claim. Every time someone looked, he sat up straighter. Smiled wider. This was his moment.

The food came — some expensive fish thing neither of them would remember — but the meal didn't matter. What mattered was the performance. Julia knew exactly what she was doing. Leaning forward just enough to give the man at the next table a view. Crossing and uncrossing her legs. Licking her lips when she took a sip of wine. Bouquet was barely eating, just watching her, mesmerized, half-hard under the table.

After dinner they dropped their things off at the hotel and walked to the Sky Bar. Lights low, DJ spinning something deep and hypnotic, bodies swaying in the purple glow. She was a meteor entering orbit. The whole room shifted. Conversations paused. Drinks were forgotten mid-sip. Even a well-known Angolan influencer — someone who had likely dated Bouquet before — noticed. She moved tables to avoid being seen, her whole crew following like she'd spotted a ghost.

Julia saw it all. But the vibe wasn't right. Too polished. Too curated. Too many people pretending not to stare. So they left. Called an Uber and headed to Pink Street — Lisbon's chaotic, carnal carnival, where staring was the point.

In the Uber, he couldn't stop touching her thighs. His hand sliding higher, fingers brushing the hem of the dress. Her legs spread just enough to flash that she really wasn't wearing anything underneath. No barrier. Just skin. He lost his mind. So much so that when they arrived, he'd left his phone behind in the back seat. Panic. But some kind soul called Julia's phone. They had to reroute, go retrieve it, then decide: call it a night? Or go back out?

Of course, they went back. Pink Street was its usual jungle. Bass thumping from every doorway, neon signs reflecting off sweat-slicked skin, the smell of spilled beer and expensive perfume mixing in the humid night air. And like in Amalfi, every time Bouquet went to get drinks, a pride of men descended. Circling. Testing. Trying their luck.

She didn't move. Didn't engage. Just sat there, legs crossed, tits glowing in the ambient light, eyes scanning the crowd like a queen surveying her domain. One guy tried to sit down. She didn't even look at him. Just shifted her body an inch — a tiny movement that said everything. He left.

Bouquet returned with the drinks, saw the vultures circling, the guys retreating, and just smiled. Shook his head in wonder. "Yeah. I'm a really lucky guy."

Back at the hotel around 3 a.m., both drunk and exhausted, they collapsed into bed. There was some kissing. Slow, sloppy, affectionate. He touched her breasts through the green dress, maybe slid a hand between her legs, felt how wet she was. But no sex. Not yet. They were saving it. Building the tension. Letting the weekend breathe.

## Saturday: The Sauna and the Sex Book

Saturday began late, with hangovers and skipped breakfast. Mouths dry, heads pounding, but neither of them cared. They packed slowly, touching between folding clothes, stealing kisses that tasted like stale alcohol and promise.

They drove to their five-star hotel at Costa da Caparica, windows down, sun beating on the dashboard, Julia's hand resting on Bouquet's thigh. On the way, they stopped for food — fresh bread, cheese, fruit — and bought wine and Martini Rosso, Julia's favourite. The bottle clinked against the car door every time they turned. At check-in, they were upgraded to a suite. Bouquet tipped the concierge like he'd just won the lottery.

Julia made them salads in the room, barefoot on the marble floor, wearing one of Bouquet's shirts and nothing else. He watched her from the bed, already hard again, amazed that this was his life. Then they changed for the pool.

She wore a tiny bikini — red, barely there, two triangles of fabric that somehow stayed on despite physics. The top was tied with strings thin as thread. The bottoms rode low on her hips, showing the curve where her ass met her thighs. When she walked past the pool, conversations stopped. Husbands hid their erections behind towels. Wives nudged their partners back to reality, whispering sharp reminders that wandering eyes had consequences.

Julia stretched out on a lounger, oil glistening on her stomach, legs slightly parted. Bouquet sat beside her, applying more oil, his hands lingering on her thighs, her ribs, the sides of her breasts. He was marking territory. Showing everyone: this one's mine.

Later, in the sauna, things escalated. The heat made everything slow and thick. Sweat beaded on her chest, running between her breasts. She looked at him through the steam, smiled that wicked smile, and dropped to her knees on the wooden bench. She sucked his cock slowly, deliberately, while he played with her tits, thumbs circling her nipples until they were hard as stones.

Then they heard voices approaching. Scrambled to sit up, act normal, pretend they were just two people enjoying the heat. An older couple entered, nodded politely, settled on the opposite bench. Julia's eyes gleamed with mischief. Bouquet was dying, trying not to show how close he'd been.

They moved to the Turkish bath — darker, more private, the tile cool against overheated skin. The blowjob resumed. Her nipples were devoured. His hands everywhere, desperate, greedy, trying to memorize every inch of her before the weekend ended.

Back in the room, Bouquet revealed the book he'd brought: *101 Nights of Great Sex*. A glossy, ridiculous thing full of scripted fantasies. Julia, now in a giddy and giving mood, flipped through it, laughing at some of the suggestions. Then she stopped on one page. Read it. Looked up at him with that dangerous glint.

"Wait in the bathroom," she said.

She changed into white cotton shorts and a thin white cotton T-shirt. Then she called him out. He emerged to find her standing by the sink, holding a glass of water, smiling like she was about to wreck him.

She splashed water over one nipple till it erupted from the wet cotton, dark and obvious. Then the other. Then a few handfuls over her pussy, until the outline of her parted lips was visible through the soaked shorts.

Then she looked deep into Bouquet's eyes, looked down at his stiff little cock straining against his boxers, and smiled wickedly before she soaked herself completely — letting the water cling to her curves, nipples pushing through fabric, the shorts transparent over her pussy lips.

And Bouquet… he just lost it.

She climbed into the tub, removed her shorts, rolled a condom onto him with practiced efficiency, and sat astride him, her soaked T-shirt clinging to her breasts, fabric plastered to her skin, his hands exploring every inch. She rode him slowly, hips rolling, grinding, taking her time. He came quickly — overwhelmed by her beauty, her effort, her gift.

They showered together afterward, still playful, washing each other's backs, kissing under the spray. Dressed casually for dinner at the hotel — Julia slipping on a short skirt and white "tits out" top, simple but sexy. Just enough to keep him interested.

After dinner, Bouquet turned serious. He dressed in a suit — actually put on a full suit in the hotel room, like he was about to propose. Then he presented — literally presented, PowerPoint and all — his dreams for their shared future.

Using a TV screen connected by a hotel technician he'd arranged in advance, he showed Julia slides of vacations he wanted to take her on: Marrakesh. Amsterdam. Paris. Pictures of hotels. Itineraries. Budgets. He even opened a joint bank account for travel, printed out the documents, slid them across the table like a contract.

Julia politely declined to share finances just yet. He accepted it without protest, but she could see the disappointment flicker across his face before he hid it behind another smile.

## The Black Lace Bodysuit: Truth or Undress

Later, he handed her a new gift: a black lace one-piece from Victoria's Secret — sheer, crotch-snappable, and designed for immediate access. The kind of thing that came in a pink bag with tissue paper and made promises it intended to keep.

She wore it for him, along with a garter belt and black nylons, the clips biting into her thighs just enough to remind her they were there. She stood in front of the mirror for a moment, adjusting the straps, checking the angle. The lace left almost nothing to the imagination — her nipples visible through the sheer fabric, the dark triangle between her legs barely concealed, the three delicate snaps at the crotch begging to be undone.

Then Bouquet had a surprise for her.

He emerged from the bathroom in his boxers and a grin, a deck of glossy sex question cards in one hand, a bottle of red wine in the other. Julia was already lying on the bed, legs crossed, swirling the last of her Martini Rosso in a hotel glass. Her black lace bodysuit clung to her like a second skin — sheer, high-cut, and closing at the crotch with just three delicate snaps. A gift from him. A weapon on her.

He shuffled the cards and smirked, trying to look confident, trying to channel some version of himself that knew how to handle a woman like her. "Truth or undress?"

She gave him a lazy smile, eyes half-lidded, already a little drunk. "Truth, always."

First card: *What's the dirtiest place you've ever had sex?*

She tilted her head, eyes twinkling with mischief. "A library."

He blinked, caught off guard. "Wait—seriously?"

"Uh-huh." She took a slow sip of her drink, letting the silence stretch. "Next question."

Second card: *Do you like being watched?*

She didn't even answer. Just reached behind her, unsnapped the crotch of the bodysuit with a flick of her fingers, and slid one finger slowly between her lips. Held his gaze. Watched his pupils dilate. Watched his breath catch in his throat.

*I saw it in his eyes — he never stood a chance.*

He dropped the cards. They scattered across the bedspread, forgotten.

She dropped the glass. It landed on the carpet with a soft thud, Martini soaking into hotel fabric.

And the black lace came away like a surrender.

She kissed her way down his chest, taking her time, stopping at his waist to toy with him, teasing with her tongue, making him squirm, making him beg without words. Then she let him take over — kissing every inch of her, from her ankles to her thighs, from her nipples to her navel. His mouth hovered at her pussy, lips grazing, teasing, lingering just close enough to make her hips lift toward him. But even at her peak, she didn't come. Couldn't. Wouldn't. Not with him.

Then she flipped onto her stomach, looked over her shoulder with that impossible smile — the one that had destroyed better men than Bouquet — and said simply, "Your turn."

He fumbled for the condom like a man possessed, hands shaking, tearing the wrapper with his teeth. Slid it on. Positioned himself behind her. Took her from behind, gripping her hips, thrusting hard and fast and desperate. Didn't last long — maybe ninety seconds — but she told him afterward it didn't matter. That it was good. That it was real. That the whole weekend had made her feel so sexy, so seen, so adored… she just wanted to give back.

He came quickly again, collapsing onto her back, breathing hard, heart pounding. But he recovered quickly too. Young. Eager. Driven by the fear that this might be his only chance. So he mounted her again, still from behind, and came again within two minutes.

She was happy she'd pleased him. Happy to give him this gift. But she was very conscious of her unfulfilled needs. That ache between her legs that wouldn't go away no matter how many times he tried. That emptiness that his "wimpy dick" — her words, not mine — couldn't quite fill.

After that, she said the booze and disappointment got to her. The Martini Rosso mixing with wine mixing with the crushing realization that Bouquet, for all his devotion, would never make her come. She just lay back, opened her legs wide, and let him eat her… while she gradually fell asleep.

His tongue worked her clit, his fingers inside her, pumping slowly, trying everything he knew. But her breathing slowed. Her body relaxed. And eventually, she just… drifted off.

At 3 a.m., she woke up. Hair messy, mascara smudged, body still giving him pleasure. He was still there. Still tracing lazy circles around her nipples with his fingertips. Still gently licking and fingering her. She was still soaking wet — her body responding even if her mind had checked out. And he was still smiling. That dopey, devoted, hopeless smile of a man who thought he'd won the lottery when really, he was just renting her for the weekend.

## Sunday: Not Ready to Let Go

Sunday morning, they slept in until noon. Their checkout was delayed until five. The hotel was hemorrhaging money, but Bouquet didn't care. He'd pay any price to stretch this weekend a few more hours.

They touched each other in bed, lazy and slow, skin still warm from sleep. His hand traced patterns on her stomach. Her leg hooked over his hip. They didn't fuck — just existed together in that golden, drowsy space where nothing else mattered.

They showered together, steam filling the bathroom, her back against the tile while he washed her hair, fingers massaging her scalp until she nearly fell asleep standing up. Then they dressed in swimsuits and went back to the pool one last time.

He got frisky again — of course he did. His hand sliding under the water, fingers finding the edge of her bikini bottoms. So they returned to the sauna, that private little hell where the heat made everything permissible.

She sucked him once more, kneeling on the wooden bench, his hands tangled in her wet hair. He played with her nipples, rolling them between his fingers, trying to memorize the weight of her breasts in his palms. Neither of them spoke. What was there to say? The weekend was ending. They both knew it.

Still not ready to end the dream, Bouquet drove them back into Lisbon, back to Avenida da Liberdade — to the start of the weekend, like he could rewind time if he just retraced their steps. They sat at Julia's favourite coffee place near her work, the one with the outdoor tables and the espresso that actually tasted like coffee. They had pastries — pastel de nata, still warm from the oven — and soaked in what had been, for him, the best 48 hours of his life.

But it wasn't enough. It would never be enough.

He dropped her home, watched her walk to her door, waited until she was inside. Then he called her back. Couldn't help himself. She answered on the second ring, laughing, asking what he wanted. He drove back, picked her up again, and they went to the riverside.

The Tagus stretched out in front of them, wide and gray under the afternoon sky. Boats drifted past. Seagulls screamed overhead. They sat on a bench, his arm around her shoulders, her head resting against his chest. They kissed. Cuddled. Touched. He didn't want to let her go.

"Don't go to Ayia Napa," he said suddenly, voice tight with something she couldn't quite name. Fear, maybe. Or desperation.

She pulled back, looked at him. "What?"

"It's dangerous," he insisted. "You won't be safe. I don't… I don't think you should go."

She laughed, kissed his cheek. "I'll be fine. It's just a girls' trip."

But he kept pressing, kept trying to convince her to stay, to cancel, to choose him over whatever was waiting for her in that party-soaked hellhole.

He had no idea.

*In retrospect, it was clear: she gave him everything that weekend. Sex. Love. Her body, her time, her care.*

Maybe part of it was revenge for my betrayal with Aline. Payback delivered in green dresses and black lace, in wet T-shirts and whispered confessions.

Maybe part of it was genuine affection. Bouquet was safe. Predictable. The kind of man who opened joint bank accounts and planned vacations and never asked for more than she was willing to give.

Maybe she was swept away by his giddy, romantic pride. The way he looked at her like she was the only woman in the world. The way he smiled when other men stared. The way he never stopped trying, even when his body failed him.

Whatever the reason, Bouquet was closer to her than I was at that point.

Like me, he was not expecting the hell that Ayia Napa unleashed.

He was actually closer to it in real time. He was calling Julia in Ayia Napa every day, checking in, making sure she was okay, trying to tether her to something solid while she spiraled.

I tried to give her space… until I was frightened for her safety after her friend left. That's when the nightmare started for me — and continued for him.

And though she was closer to Bouquet during Ayia Napa, it was me, not him, she asked money from when she got sick… for a rebooked return flight. She didn't want his joint account, but she sequestered mine.

I was now the donkey. And surprise, surprise… Bouquet was the tiger.

When she finally returned, sick from Ayia Napa, it was him she saw first on Friday. And spent another hotel night with. And the following day.

But that's another story. And he didn't know just how close his end was… or the clinging short green dress she would wear to see me on Sunday. Or the new pools on my kitchen floor.

So, just two weeks after the best sex of his life, his world would completely collapse.

He — and I — only knew that Julia was about to fly to Ayia Napa… and become something — someone — neither of us could ever have predicted.

Not even in our worst nightmares.
