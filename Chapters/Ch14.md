# Chapter 14: Between Granada and the Hurricane

**Hybrid Assembly:** 5 scenes compressed (C2) + 2 scenes at baseline (C1)


## The Choice

The text came on a Wednesday in early June.

*Mother has had a bad stroke. She may not live long.*

I was in Lisbon. My eldest daughter was in Belgium with my granddaughter—fifteen months old, never met her great-grandmother. We'd planned to drive together to England for my mother's ninety-seventh birthday. The Cotswolds first, then north to her small town. My son would join us Saturday, leave Sunday. It was all arranged.

Do I cancel? Fly straight to her bedside?

But my daughter couldn't manage the trip alone with the baby. And I knew exactly what my mother would say: *Come over with your daughter. Take the Cotswold side trip. Let me recover a bit.*

So we went. Cotswolds first. Beautiful hotel in Upper Slaughter. Sunday lunch, river walk, beers at Diddly Squat's brewery. My granddaughter feeding chips to an undeserving duck. Laughter. For a moment, I forgot why I was here.

By Tuesday, the weather turned. We drove north in rain, fields flattening, England losing its postcard glow.

The hospital smell hit first—antiseptic and something faintly sour. My brother stood in the corridor, shoulders bowed, eyes raw.

"She's not herself," he warned.

Four generations around that bed. I took a picture—fifteen months and ninety-seven years, the full circle of life in one frame.

I couldn't feel sad. She was a month shy of ninety-seven. Fiercely independent to the end. She'd had a good life—long and strong. I would have signed up for that. She wouldn't want this. In her position, I wouldn't either.

But my brother saw things differently.

She refused food. We didn't let the hospital force her. Slow starvation began. We found her the best local care home. My middle daughter came to say goodbye, then drove back Saturday with her sister and niece. I stayed, moving in with my brother.

Physically, she recovered from the stroke. But as her body weakened, her mind unraveled. Proud. Stubborn. She knew her independence was over. She knew she wanted the end.

My brother started to fray. I was the one holding it together. Until the night I told her that her nightly terrors were in her head.

She turned on me. Told me to go home. Turned her sharpness on my brother too. Said she only wanted to see her younger sister. And she said other things—things that couldn't be unsaid.

On the second Sunday, I flew back to Lisbon. Told him I'd be back for the funeral. She was in the care home. The funeral director had been informed. We even knew it would take four weeks between her death and the funeral.

I told my brother to keep strong.

A few days after I left, he unraveled completely. Took a cot in her room and stayed there 24/7 for the last five days of her life. I considered it self-flagellation. He called it respect.

That set the scene for the huge fight over the funeral.


Meanwhile, Julia was buzzing. After two weeks in England thick with stress and loss, I needed a break. I thought we could fit in a vacation before the funeral.

We discussed options. She wanted the cruise.

So we booked it—Venice to Mykonos, Santorini, and back again. Balcony cabin. Champagne on arrival. She'd already mapped out outfits for each port, each dinner. This time, she'd take her five new dresses—her own designs, fresh from the manufacturer—one for every night onboard.

Then the message came from my brother:

*She's gone.*

No warning. No soft preamble. Just three words.

She had died sooner than I expected. When I'd left, she was still strong. I'd guessed another two weeks. Then she'd tried to climb the walls. That's when the tranquilizers and morphine drip started—the cocktail that kept her quiet until the end.

The death certificate arrived. My brother registered it. Funeral planning began.

What I hadn't foreseen—and wouldn't learn until later—was that the vicar was going on vacation. That set a deadline. My brother claimed it was "indecent" to wait four weeks; I suspected it was more about his schedule than decorum.

Then my eldest daughter added her own constraint: she wanted to take her daughter to Knokke the week after the cruise.

That's when my brother asked when I'd booked the cruise.

I told him.

He exploded.

*"Good God, Steve, have you no shame? You arranged a holiday immediately after your mother died because you thought you could squeeze one in, on the basis of an initial comment by the undertaker!*

*I don't know when the funeral will be because I still have to check with other essential participants. But I have to say—your attitude is callous beyond belief!"*

So the choice came down to this: cancel the cruise, force my daughter to give up her week in Knokke, or miss the funeral myself.

On paper, the choice was simple.

In my head, it wasn't.

If I cancelled, I'd lose thousands—and more than that, Julia's excitement. This trip was meant to be a celebration, a reset after months of drift. I knew that if I told her about the funeral, she'd insist on cancelling the cruise. So I didn't tell her.

If I went, I'd miss my mother's funeral—the final act of respect, the last thread holding my brother and me together.

But stubbornness runs in the family. My mother had it. I have it. My brother too. Her final words still played in my head. So did his rebuke. And after almost forty years of adjusting myself to keep family peace, my parents were gone. The reason for peace was gone too.

I told my daughter she could have her week, and that I wouldn't be at the funeral.

I knew my brother would see it as a betrayal, but I hoped time would soften his anger.

I texted him my decision.

Hours later, his reply:

*I don't believe you're doing this.*

And then nothing. No calls. No more messages.

I didn't bury my mother. I boarded a ship instead.

And somewhere out there, on that wide strip of blue between islands, I buried something else.

## March Drift

But that was June. The drift started in March—right after Granada.

Days after the birthday trip, I felt it. Slower replies. Kisses landing ambiguously. A sleepiness in her voice, as if half of her had somewhere else to be.

Irish "respected her decision," she said. He was sad—didn't want to give up on her because she was "someone who would turn him to a better person."

The familiar story. Another man wanting to be remade by her.

Two days later, a message poured into my chest:

*I really NEED and want you to know how much I love you… All I think about is YOU. When I wake up I pick up my phone looking for a notification from YOU… I care for you like nobody else. I love you like nobody else… You're the ONLY person I've ever cared and loved like this.*

My heart softened instantly.

Within 48 hours, we were back to our old patterns. Late-night requests. Nights with Hillary. Money asks wrapped in emojis.

"I'm turning 25 and I need to get the brand thing going."

"I've turned 73 and I'm only just getting mine going. Don't stress yourself so much."

Five days later, another request—bigger this time.

"It's pointless with you," I told her. "You're incorrigible 😂😂."


## The Chiado Seduction

It was meant to be just another girls' night.

Hillary, another friend, and Julia—three striking women dressed for Lisbon's warm night air. Julia chose a long dress that clung and flowed at the same time, her breasts half-unveiled, midriff bare.

They booked a table at Palácio Chiado—a restaurant that feels like you're eating in a Renaissance painting. That's where they saw them: a group of Italians on a bachelor weekend. Not the usual stag-night rabble—these men wore tailored shirts, had gel-perfect hair, and carried the easy swagger of men raised on constant validation.

The moment her group walked in, the air shifted. Chairs stilled, conversation dipped. Men nudged each other, muttered *que bella*.

When she got up to go to the bathroom, the groom intercepted her with a shot in hand. She laughed and knocked it back. When she came back upstairs, there was a neat line of shots waiting. The groom challenged her. Seven shots vanished in quick succession.

After dinner, the two groups merged and drifted downstairs to the grand bar. More drinks. More flirting.

The groom kept finding reasons to brush her hand. He told her the whole group wanted her and that she could have whoever she wanted… or all of them. One shouted back, "I don't want her, I want you." The rest laughed, but the subtext was clear: they were all letting the groom have first pick.

They shared Ubers to the club, Hillary in the back row with her chosen Italian. Later, she whispered to Julia, *he had his fingers in my cookie… and he has a huge dick too. But I didn't shave tonight, so I'm not going to fuck him.*

It was a ritual the two women shared—no shave nights as a safety net against temptation.

By the time they hit the club, the atmosphere was electric. They danced. They flirted. The groom pushed closer.

At one point, he leaned in and said, "I've got something I'd love to show you."

Julia, drunk but still sharp enough to parry, smiled: "I have something to show you too."

He led her toward the ladies' toilet. Inside, he unzipped and pulled out his cock, already hard.

That was the moment, she told me later, when the haze cleared.

*He's getting married. This is someone's future husband. If I keep going, I'm cheating with him on a woman I've never met.*

The thought hit like cold water.

She spun, bolted out, brushing past a startled young woman on her way in. Behind her, the groom fumbled to hide himself and called out, "Stop, Julia, stop!"

She didn't.

She found Hillary on the dance floor, grabbed her arm, and said, "We're going home. Now."

The groom made one last attempt: *We're going to Ericeira tomorrow, come with us—all of you.* But the spell had broken.

When she told me the story the next day, she painted every detail—the dress, the shots, the way the groom's cologne mingled with the humid club air. I laughed with her, but something in me tightened. I could see him. I could smell the scene she described. And I couldn't stop replaying it.

A week later, I went to Palácio Chiado with another woman. Sat at the same bar. Ordered the same wine. Tried to replace the ghost of her laughter with someone else's.

Even after I fucked her, it didn't work.

Her voice was still echoing in the arches.


## The Freeze

The week after Chiado, her voice haunted me. Not the one telling the story—the imagined one, low and breathless in a bathroom stall, teasing a man she'd just met.

We still saw each other, still slept in the same bed. But there was a drag on the line.

She finally said it out loud:

*I do need the attention to feel good about myself… my reservoirs drain in a day or two.*

I teased her, but it was truth neither of us could laugh away. Her attention tanks were leaky. Mine were running dry.

Sex was the first casualty. The vibrator stayed. My cock didn't.

*I think since all that threesome story and Aline, I've started to dislike men… cause you were the person I used to admire.*

It wasn't just dislike—it was a freeze. She'd touch me, then her mind would drift somewhere else.

*I'm at a point where I'm afraid of getting intimate… cause it makes me think I'm just another person they're fucking.*

That "they" wasn't me. It was everyone. Ghosts of other lovers in her head. Ghosts in mine.

By mid-March, we made a one-week trial—no in-person meetings. Text and calls only. We pretended it was a reset. Really, it was reconnaissance.

Day five:

*I also wanted to say that I love you so much and we should forget the 1-week trial… but then I thought about it and told myself it's maybe better.*

When we met again:

*Next time we meet let's try. I need you to only make me think about you and no one else.*

I wanted to believe it. But somewhere between the ghosts, the jealousy, and the silence, we'd both started thinking about other people.


## April Illness

It started with a text that didn't sound like her:

*Bby, I don't feel good.*

By the time she came over, she was pale and glassy-eyed, swallowing with effort. Voice raw, almost gone.

I went full biohacker mode. Ginger and turmeric until the kitchen smelled like a spice market. Vitamin C, zinc, quercetin. Vapour bowls with eucalyptus. Warm salt gargles.

That night I slept light, waking every couple of hours to check her temperature. Each time, the same small smile—weak, grateful, and for a moment, entirely mine.

At the hospital, she leaned against me in the waiting area, oversized hoodie draped over her frame, phone idle. Severe throat infection. Antibiotics. Pain relief. Rest.

Later, she texted:

*Thank you for taking care of me… I couldn't have done it without you.*

A small thing, typed between doses, but it hit harder than her longest love declarations. In a season where she was drifting into her own orbit, here was a moment—brief, fever-flushed, fragile—where she'd let me anchor her.


## The 25th Birthday

Two weeks later she stood in front of the mirror, transformed—dress hugging her curves, engineered to show what she wanted and hide what she didn't.

That night, out with Hillary and Angolan friends, Cilla—one of the louder voices—launched into a monologue.

"I have many older boyfriends. They give me money. I would never date a man who didn't give me money."

Not whispered. Announced, like a point of pride. Julia blinked at her, caught between shock and fascinated discomfort.

Later, she told me how unsettled she was—how transactional Cilla's view was, how bluntly she stripped away any pretense.

The party rolled on. Photos, toasts, music edging louder. Julia shone at the center—laughing, dancing, leaning into the warm tide of attention.

I wasn't there. My part in her 25th: a message, a call, a private gift—a Canon camera.

Yet somewhere in that glitter and laughter, she'd been reminded that not every orbit around an older man was about love or desire. Some were just about money.

That truth would linger… for both of us… even if she didn't say it out loud again.


## May

May was half-light. Quick "I love you" texts one day, hours of silence the next. Money asks wrapped in emojis. Mini-storms—"Are you with someone?"—when I didn't reply fast enough.

When she was out, her texts clipped to nothing. "All good." "Talk later." I'd imagine the room, the eyes on her. She told me nothing. That told me everything.

The cracks weren't obvious yet. But the fabric was stretching.

And mother's funeral was Thursday.
