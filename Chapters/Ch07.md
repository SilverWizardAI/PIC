# Chapter 7: Return to Lisbon

## Scene 1: Home Again: Atlantic Breeze

I was glad to be home.

After a June that felt like hell's waiting room — airless days in Cyprus where even the cold tap ran at 30 degrees, where my skin stuck to leather car seats and my thoughts stuck to Julia's conquests — Lisbon's Atlantic breeze was salvation. The moment I stepped off the plane at Portela, I felt it: that cool kiss of ocean air that Cascais breathes into your lungs without asking permission. It was relief my skin could taste.

I drove straight to the house. My house. The one I'd bought and gutted with my ex-wife years ago, back when we thought clean lines and skylights could save a marriage. She was long gone. But the bones of the place — the polished concrete floors, the industrial steel beams, the massive windows that framed the Atlantic like living paintings — remained. Two bedrooms. Minimal furniture. A bachelor pad that looked like it belonged to an architect with commitment issues.

It was my sanctuary now.

And I needed a sanctuary.

I dropped my bags in the bedroom, threw open the terrace doors, and let the wind sweep through. Eighteen degrees. Cool nights. The kind of temperature that lets you sleep naked under a single sheet without waking up drenched. The kind of air that clears your head.

Or at least, I hoped it would.

Because my head was a mess.

Cyprus had broken something in me. Not physically — though the heat had been relentless, suffocating, punishing. But psychologically. Julia's slow-drip confessions about her spring rampage had lodged in my skull like shrapnel. The Italian with the hotel charm and the huge cock. The Spaniard who fucked her for four hours and stayed hard. The American with the stomach-ache dick who made her scream so loud they got thrown out of the hotel. The Greek who painted the sheets red while she bled and came.

I'd heard it all. In fragments. In pillow talk. In post-orgasm vulnerability when her eyes went soft and she thought honesty was intimacy.

And it had destroyed my erection.

Not with other women — I'd checked. But with her. Only with her.

So I'd fled back to Lisbon, hoping distance and ocean air would flush the ghosts out. Hoping that being home — being in control of my environment again — would restore me. Would restore us.

Julia had just returned from the Amalfi Coast.

A week with Mr. Bouquet.

The polite banker. Soft eyes. Luxury car. A penis that gave up before it even started.

He wasn't her usual type. No danger. No dominance. No primal sexual chemistry. But he treated her like royalty. He sent flowers to her house. To her mother's house. To her sisters. Probably to her ovaries, if he could figure out the address. He called her every day. Took her to Michelin-starred restaurants and rooftop bars overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea. He even made PowerPoint presentations — actual fucking slides — mapping out the exotic getaways he was planning for them. Maldives. Seychelles. Bali.

He was courting her the old-fashioned way.

And Julia… she liked it.

He didn't thrill her. But he nourished her. Fed the little girl inside her that still longed to be cherished, adored, protected. The part of her that wanted roses and phone calls and a man who made plans instead of chaos.

I understood that.

I even encouraged it.

In some warped, strategic corner of my mind, I thought that helping her explore safe love would bring her back to me. That if she tasted the bland comfort of a nice guy — someone who worshipped her but couldn't fuck her, who offered stability but no fire — she'd remember what we had. What we were.

She'd come back to real love. Back to dangerous love. Back to us.

That was my plan.

As if Julia had ever been manageable by plans.

I stood on my terrace that first night back, shirtless, holding a glass of Douro red, watching the Atlantic roll in under a purple sky. The breeze lifted the hair on my arms. I breathed deep. Tried to reset.

But even then, I could feel it.

The pause before the storm.

The thing Julia always carried with her — that restless, bottomless hunger — was still out there, circling. And Mr. Bouquet's PowerPoints weren't going to satisfy it.

Neither was I.

Not anymore.

Not until I figured out how to fuck her again without my dick remembering every man who'd been there before me.

## Scene 2: Monogamous... Briefly

For a few weeks, we were monogamous again.

Or at least, we pretended to be.

Neither of us was actively hunting. No dating apps. No late-night messages to strangers. No plans to meet anyone new.

Julia said the big-dick phase was over. She was done with conquest. Done with the Italian, the Spaniard, the Greek, the American. She'd explored that territory, mapped it out, and now she needed something else.

What she craved now was TLC.

Tenderness. Care. Attention. Adoration without demands.

And Mr. Bouquet was feeding that craving beautifully. Flowers delivered to her door. Phone calls every evening at 8pm, reliable as clockwork. He took her to rooftop bars where the wine was expensive and the sunset was free. He sent her links to luxury hotels in the Maldives and asked — with soft, careful hope — if she might consider joining him.

He wasn't sexually active with her yet. And that seemed to suit them both.

She liked being wanted without being consumed.

And I… I encouraged it.

A few weeks into their chaste courtship, I was the one who pushed her.

"You should give him a real chance," I said one afternoon, sitting across from her at my kitchen table. We'd just finished lunch — one of her salads, the kind she'd grown addicted to. Mixed greens, smoked salmon, mozzarella di bufala, my beetroot side dish drowning in olive oil and balsamico.

She looked at me, fork paused mid-air.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean… sleep with him. Just to know."

She blinked. Then laughed. A short, confused laugh.

"You're telling me to fuck him?"

I shrugged, playing it casual. Emotionally evolved. Generous.

"I'm telling you to find out if there's anything there. If he can actually satisfy you."

She studied me for a long moment, then smiled. A small, knowing smile.

"You think he can't."

I didn't answer. Didn't need to.

We both knew.

But the game — the strategy — was that if she tried him and he failed, she'd come back to me grateful. Confirmed. Certain.

I played the same card with Mr. Nice Guy.

The one who'd once slept beside her in bed — literally beside her, while she wore only a bra and panties — and didn't touch her. Didn't even get hard. Just lay there like a eunuch at a Roman orgy.

She thought he might be gay.

"Test it," I told her. "Seduce him. See what happens."

Curiosity and strategy disguised as generosity.

I thought I was being clever.

But even as I played the role of the emotionally evolved lover — the enlightened man who could handle his woman exploring other men — my own cracks were reopening.

Because the details kept coming.

Her springtime adventures. Her Nympho Spring.

They dripped out of her lips in my kitchen. Over lunch. Over wine. After sex, when her defenses were down and honesty felt like intimacy.

She'd tell me little things. Casually. Like she was recounting a movie she'd seen.

"He came five times," she said once, talking about the Spaniard. "And he was still hard after. I've never seen anything like it."

Or: "The Greek… God, he was rough. I bled. But I didn't want him to stop."

Or: "The American had this dick that felt like it was hitting my stomach. I thought I was going to vomit. But in a good way."

She laughed when she said these things. Reliving them. Tasting them again.

And I sat there, nodding, holding my wine glass, pretending it didn't gut me.

But those truths floated in like perfume. Invisible. Pervasive. Choking.

And the demons in my head began to whisper louder.

My erection — my long-trusted, reliable companion — began to wobble when I was with her.

Then fade.

Then vanish altogether.

It didn't happen all at once. It was gradual. Insidious.

One night, we were in bed. She was on top of me, grinding slowly, her hands on my chest. I felt myself softening inside her. She noticed. Slowed down. Looked at me with concern.

"You okay?"

"Yeah," I lied. "Just distracted."

But it kept happening.

And the panic set in.

Was it my age? I was past seventy, sure, but the biohacking had kept me running — I'd never had problems before. Was it my prostate? Should I see a doctor? Had my long-trusted ED therapist — the little blue pill I kept in my nightstand — finally failed me?

Or was it Julia?

Was she still inside my head — rewiring my arousal, choking my confidence, haunting every attempt at intimacy with the ghosts of men who'd fucked her better?

I didn't know.

But I needed to find out.

## Scene 3: Testing My Erection: Aline and Luiza

I needed to know.

Was it my body? Or was it my mind?

Was I broken — genuinely broken, aging out of virility, prostate failing, testosterone dropping — or was Julia inside my head, rewiring my arousal into something conditional and fragile?

I couldn't live with the uncertainty.

So I tested it.

I reached out to women I'd known. Women nearby who once made me feel invincible. Women who remembered me as confident, dominant, unshakable.

Aline. Luiza.

Both lived in Cascais. Both had fucked me before — back when I was still whole, before Julia had detonated my sexual confidence like a car bomb.

I messaged them casually. Separately.

"Hey. You around? Want to grab a drink?"

They both said yes.

Aline came over first.

She arrived on a Thursday evening, hair tied back, wearing jeans and a loose t-shirt that somehow made her look more fuckable than any lingerie could. She'd always been like that — effortlessly sexual, comfortable in her body, no performance required.

We sat on my terrace with wine. Made small talk. Flirted with our eyes.

I didn't tell her why I'd called. Didn't explain the test. I just let the evening unfold naturally, waiting to see if my body would cooperate.

When I kissed her — slow, deliberate, my hand sliding up her thigh — I felt it.

The familiar surge. Blood rushing. Confidence rising.

No wobble. No fade. No ghosts.

We moved to the bedroom. I undressed her slowly, savoring it. Her skin under my hands felt real. Tangible. Uncomplicated.

I fucked her hard.

Not rough — just certain. Focused. Present.

I bent her over the edge of the bed, hands gripping her hips, and I took her with the kind of deliberate intensity that I used to own. She moaned. Pushed back against me. Came twice.

And I stayed hard the entire time.

No doubt. No hesitation. No soft moments.

When it was over, we lay in bed for a while, catching our breath. She curled into my shoulder, fingers tracing lazy circles on my chest.

"I missed this," she murmured.

I didn't reply. I was too busy cataloging the data.

Erection: strong.

Confidence: intact.

Conclusion: not my dick.

A few days later, I called Luiza.

She was different from Aline — younger, more playful, with a laugh that made sex feel like a game instead of a war. We'd had a brief fling the year before, and she'd always made me feel like a god in bed.

She came over on a Sunday afternoon. We skipped the wine and went straight to my bedroom, laughing as we undressed each other like teenagers sneaking around.

I fucked her differently than I'd fucked Aline. Lighter. More playful. But just as hard. Just as confident.

She wrapped her legs around my waist, pulled me deeper, whispered filthy things in Portuguese that made my cock pulse.

And again — no problems.

No softness. No fading. No panic.

I came inside her, collapsed beside her, and stared at the ceiling while she caught her breath.

"Jesus," she laughed, turning to kiss my shoulder. "You're in a mood."

I smiled. But inside, the realization was settling like a stone in my gut.

It wasn't my dick.

It wasn't my age.

It wasn't my prostate or my hormones or my long-trusted blue pill.

It was Julia.

Or more specifically: it was me and Julia.

The combination of us — the history, the betrayals, the images seared into my brain of other men inside her — had rewired my arousal into something broken and conditional.

I could fuck other women just fine.

But with Julia — the woman I loved, the woman I'd opened to this lifestyle, the woman I'd encouraged to explore her sexuality — my body had learned to associate her with humiliation. With loss. With ghosts.

And no amount of Viagra could fix that.

I lay in bed after Luiza left, windows open, listening to the Atlantic breeze stir the curtains.

I'd gotten my answer.

But I wasn't sure I wanted it.

## Scene 4: The Makeup on the Sheets

Eventually, I couldn't hide it.

Or maybe I didn't want to.

Maybe part of me — some self-destructive corner of my psyche — wanted to be caught. Wanted the lie to collapse. Wanted her to find out so I could stop carrying the weight of it alone.

She'd been suspicious for days. I could feel it in the way she watched me. The way her eyes lingered on my phone when I put it down. The way she asked casual questions that weren't casual at all.

"Where were you Thursday night?"

"Just home. Why?"

"No reason."

But there was always a reason with Julia.

Maybe she'd seen something on my phone when she was choosing songs on Spotify for my Alexa speaker. A name. A message preview. A timeline that didn't add up.

But what sealed it… was the bed.

It was a quiet afternoon. Late July. The kind of day where Lisbon heat mellowed into a drowsy, wine-soaked afternoon.

We'd just had lunch on my terrace. One of the salads she'd grown addicted to — mixed greens, boiled eggs, smoked salmon, mozzarella di bufala, with my signature beetroot side dish drowning in olive oil, balsamico, and flaky sea salt.

A proper biohacker's lunch.

And of course, a bottle of Papa Figos — our favorite Douro red. Deep. Earthy. The kind of wine that made you want to fuck before the bottle was empty.

We sat opposite each other, feet tangled under the table, her toes teasing me through my shorts. She was wearing a loose sundress. No bra. Her skin glowing from the sun and the wine.

We flirted. Laughed. Pretended everything was fine.

And by the time the wine peaked and the flirting turned heavy, we moved toward the bedroom.

I led her inside, her hand in mine, pulling her close. I kissed her neck. Felt her pulse quicken under my lips.

I walked to the bed and pulled back the sheets — a lazy, confident gesture, inviting her to lie down so I could bury my face between her thighs.

And that's when she froze.

She stared at the pillow. Then the base sheet.

I followed her gaze.

Makeup.

Mascara, maybe. Or foundation. Faint, but unmistakable. A smudge on the white cotton pillowcase that didn't belong to her.

Not hers.

Her eyes didn't blink.

She stood there, perfectly still, her breath shallow. I watched her face shift — confusion first, then understanding, then something colder.

She turned slowly, like a lioness sensing a trap.

"Are you seeing someone else?" she asked.

Her voice was quiet. Dangerously quiet.

My instinct — the old masculine reflex — was to lie.

To dodge. Deflect. Blur the edges.

"What? No. That's probably from—"

But then I stopped.

Because I saw it myself.

The smudge. The proof. The ghost of Aline's face pressed into my pillow.

And I knew.

There was no way out.

"…yes," I said. Quiet. Defeated.

Julia didn't scream. Didn't cry. Didn't throw anything.

She just stared at me for a long moment, her face unreadable.

Then she said, very calmly:

"But I thought we were being monogamous."

I had no reply. Not one that would help. Not one that didn't sound like justification or cowardice.

She stood there, arms crossed, waiting for me to say something. Anything.

But what could I say?

That I'd tested my erection with other women because hers had broken me?

That I'd needed to know if my dick still worked?

That I'd been terrified of my own impotence and used Aline and Luiza as proof of concept?

None of that would make it better.

So I said nothing.

Julia nodded slowly, like she'd expected exactly that.

Then she gathered her things.

Slowly. Methodically. No drama. Just distance.

Her phone. Her sunglasses. Her little crossbody bag.

She moved with eerie calm, like someone executing a pre-planned exit strategy.

A silent, surgical withdrawal.

I stood by the bed, paralyzed, watching her erase herself from my space.

When she was ready, she turned to me.

"Call me an Uber."

Her voice was flat. Empty.

I pulled out my phone. Opened the app. Ordered the ride. My hands were shaking.

"Five minutes," I said.

She nodded. Walked to the living room. Sat on the couch. Stared at the wall.

I stood in the doorway, wanting to say something. To apologize. To explain.

But she didn't look at me.

The silence was unbearable.

When the Uber notification pinged, she stood up without a word.

Walked to the door.

I followed her.

"Julia—"

"Don't."

She opened the door. Stepped outside.

Didn't slam it. Didn't threaten to block me. Didn't tell me who else she'd be seeing next.

But I knew.

That was the moment she tilted.

Toward Bouquet — the only other man who could fill her TLC tanks. The man with the flowers. The gentle eyes. The easy worship.

And toward Nice Guy — the one who'd once shared her bed and kept his hands to himself. The one who never made her feel like an object or an option.

The makeup on my bed was their winning lottery ticket.

They would both finally get to fuck Julia.

And Bouquet would get the jackpot.

A naughty weekend away.

Sex in the sauna. A striptease. And later, a chance to gorge himself on her pussy before he finally fucked her.

Badly.

Because men like him always did.

But that didn't matter anymore.

Because I'd lost her.

And she was going to make sure I knew exactly what that cost.

## Scene 5: The Down Payment

And little did I know that the makeup on the sheets wasn't just a betrayal.

It was a down payment.

A few weeks later, Julia came back.

Not to reconcile. Not to forgive.

To collect.

She sat across from me at my kitchen table — the same table where we'd eaten salads and flirted with our feet tangled — and she told me everything.

Calmly. Deliberately. Eyes sparkling with a kind of vindictive joy I'd never seen in her before.

She wanted me to know.

Every. Single. Detail.

"I fucked Nice Guy," she said, sipping her wine like she was discussing the weather.

I said nothing. Just sat there, gripping my glass.

"Remember him?" she continued. "The one who slept in my bed and didn't touch me? The one I thought was gay?"

I nodded.

"Well. He's not gay."

She smiled. A small, satisfied smile.

"He came over the day after I found the makeup. I was angry. Hurt. I needed to feel wanted. So I texted him. And he came."

She paused, watching my face.

"We didn't even make it to the bedroom. I pulled him onto the couch. Kissed him. Straddled him. He was hard in seconds."

I felt something twist in my chest.

"He fucked me right there. On my couch. For an hour. And you know what?"

I didn't answer.

"He was better than I expected."

She let that sit for a moment. Then continued.

"And Bouquet."

She laughed. A light, musical laugh.

"Poor Bouquet. He finally got his weekend away. Took me to a spa resort. Sauna. Champagne. Rose petals. The whole romantic package."

I could see it in my head. Her naked in the steam. His soft hands on her skin.

"He tried so hard," she said. "He ate me out for, like, thirty minutes. Made me come twice. But when it was time to fuck…"

She shook her head, still smiling.

"Same problem as before. He got hard enough to get inside me, but then… nothing. Soft. Again."

She shrugged.

"But he worshipped me. And honestly? That felt good."

She took another sip of wine, eyes locked on mine.

"So yeah. They both got their chance. Thanks to you."

I sat there, paralyzed. Ashamed. Angry. Powerless.

And that's when she moved in for the real ask.

"I want to go to Ayia Napa."

I blinked.

"What?"

"Ayia Napa. With Sophia. My girlfriend from Cyprus. She's been begging me to come. A week. Just us. Clubs. Beach. Freedom."

She leaned forward slightly.

"And you owe me."

There it was.

The leverage.

The guilt I carried — that quiet, suffocating shame from Aline's lipstick — was now currency.

And Julia knew exactly how to spend it.

"A week?" I said.

"A week."

I wanted to say no. To tell her that Ayia Napa was a fuck-fest, a meat market, a place where young, beautiful women like her got devoured by predators.

But I had no ground to stand on.

No moral authority.

No right to say no.

"Okay," I said. Quiet. Defeated.

She smiled. A real smile this time.

"Thank you."

And that was that.

A few weeks later, she flew to Ayia Napa.

The eastern Mediterranean fleshpot. A younger, hotter, more primal version of Ibiza.

A week that changed everything.

The week that crowned her.

The week she became the sex goddess I'd always told her she was.

It started in the back of a big people-mover taxi — her and Sophia and four horny guys they'd met at the airport.

She told me later.

Zürich was sitting next to her. Tall. Muscular. Cocky.

Within five minutes of the ride, his hand was on her thigh.

Ten minutes in, she was stroking his cock through his shorts while he fingered her pussy and juggled her Double Ds with his free hand.

Sophia was doing the same with another guy across the van.

The taxi driver kept glancing in the rearview mirror, his eyes wide, his knuckles white on the steering wheel.

Finally, he couldn't take it anymore.

"What's going on back there!?" he cried out, half-laughing, half-envious.

Julia and Sophia just laughed.

And the week unfolded from there.

Clubs. Beaches. Pool parties. Bodies. Music. Lust.

By the end of it, she was at the center of everything.

Surrounded by beautiful girls and horny boys.

Dancing. Smiling. Adored. Worshipped.

Crowned.

The Queen of Ayia Napa.

And when she came back to Lisbon, glowing and victorious, she sat across from me again and told me every single detail.

Because she knew.

The makeup on my sheets had been a down payment.

And Ayia Napa was the interest.
