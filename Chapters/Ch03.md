# Chapter 3: First Cyprus Trip

## Alone in Cyprus

I'd been in Cyprus since late November. Biohacking, sea walks, cold showers, weekly tennis. I'd made a quiet base in Paphos. Safe. Predictable. Boring.

Christmas: I drove my white Mini Clubman up to Kyrenia, where I'd met a 22-year-old Nigerian model. Long braids, chocolate skin, dancer's body. On Christmas morning, after she'd come three or four times, I watched her pad naked into the kitchen, humming as she fried something spicy, her braids falling past her perfect ass.

Visually perfect. Completely empty. No intimacy. Just two bodies in temporary orbit.

Weeks later: South America. Cartagena, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Rio, Miami Beach. Learning to be alone. Sampling local beauty. Testing my curiosity and solo travel independence.

Julia was still in Lisbon. Working. Waiting. Texting me photos that made my dick twitch. Her solo trip to Madrid before I left for South America had been hot—intense sex, soapy squirts in a narrow Spanish shower—but on Sunday she refused lunch. Said she wasn't feeling well.

I didn't understand yet how shame worked inside her. How even daylight could trigger shutdown. Not just with me—with any man.

A year later, at a Christmas party in Lisbon, she'd tell a handsome Frenchman she was drunk and horny. They'd fuck for hours. He'd ghost her a month later. Then she'd reactivate her Seeking.com account and let a Portuguese businessman play with her DDs in the back of his luxury car until he came in her hand. Daylight shame would seem like a distant memory by then.

## She Arrives: The Italian Airport

After Orthodox Easter, Julia flew to Cyprus. My idea, I think. Life in Lisbon without me had dulled. She missed me. Wanted more. But I didn't realize how much. For me, her visit was a welcome distraction—someone familiar in my quiet, over-disciplined life.

The flight was long. Ryanair to Italy, then on to Paphos. The layover in that Italian airport—that's where it started.

Italian men swarmed her like she was an exotic princess. Bold. Hungry. Relentless. Some told her to stay. "Why go to Cyprus?" they said. "Come with us. We'll show you Italy."

She wasn't yet afraid of Italian men. She hadn't met the big-dick businessman who would try to pummel her into submission nine months later in Lisbon. But she already sensed something predatory. Her body lit them up. Her presence disturbed their equilibrium.

It was a full foretaste of what would come in Amalfi a year later—when Bouquet daren't even leave her to pee, knowing the swarm would close in the moment he turned his back. And even his presence wasn't enough to stop them: "Come on our boat. Bring your girlfriends. We'll pay for everything."

By the time she landed in Cyprus, she was glowing. Nervous. Magnetic. She pulled her suitcase with exaggerated elegance, like some soft-bellied storm about to enter my quiet little cocoon.

## The Cocoon: Sex and Skin and Tenderness

The first days were slow. I cooked for us—basic salads, eggs, something grilled. We didn't go out. Her shame wouldn't allow it. I offered. She said she preferred to stay in.

Truth was, we both did.

Our rhythm fell into something almost monastic. We fucked. Slept. Fucked again. She'd wake me at 3 or 4 a.m., her lips brushing my shoulder, whispering "baby… I need you."

Her favorite position that week was spooning. She on her left side. Me behind her. My right hand on her DD breasts. My left arm tucked under her neck. Her ass pressed back, wet and ready. My cock sliding in deep, slow, wrapped in heat and closeness.

She'd sigh and press into me, sometimes moaning softly, sometimes entering that trance—that deep nipple high where time dissolved and her voice dropped to an almost inaudible whisper:

"I don't want to come yet… I want to stay here forever…"

And I believed her. In those moments, I felt it too. The suspension. The sacred pause. Like we'd found some pocket dimension where shame didn't exist and pleasure could stretch endlessly without consequence.

We'd usually start with her on top. The twins in my hands. Her nipples in my mouth. At that stage I hadn't yet mastered the magic of licking both nipples at once, or squeezing her breasts together with just the right tension. But I was close.

She was showing me, wordlessly, what unlocked her.

And something else was unlocking too. Something neither of us had names for yet. A softening. A shift from transaction to transformation. She wasn't performing. She wasn't surviving. She was surrendering.

Not to me—to us.

## The Uber Driver Story

One afternoon—maybe Wednesday, maybe Thursday—during one of those soft, lazy comedown interludes, she told me about an Uber driver.

A story I would never forget.

It was before she met me. After the breakup with her first Angolan boyfriend, but before the guy from Porto. She was still sexually innocent. Emotionally raw. Her friends and sisters had told her to get out, accept attention, shake off the sadness.

So she did.

The Uber driver was hot. White. Confident. He got her number after a ride and suggested they go out. She agreed. But instead of taking her somewhere nice, he drove to a dark stretch of wasteland.

Probably not his first time.

He parked. Talked. Touched her. She didn't know how to say no—not back then. She'd been manipulated so much in her first relationship. She didn't know her boundaries. Certainly didn't know her worth.

They kissed. He fondled. Pulled her into the back seat. More kisses. Groping. He put on a condom. Fucked her from behind. Then again.

Somewhere along the line, he slipped the condom off.

Came inside her.

Twice.

When she realized, she panicked. "I thought you knew," he said.

The lie was so casual. So practiced. Like he'd said it before. Like her panic was predictable, expected, almost boring to him.

She got dressed. Told him to take her home. Blocked him.

Next day, she took the morning-after pill. Looked him up. Found out he had kids with three different women. Married to none.

She told me this story with her head on my chest, her voice flat and distant, like she was narrating someone else's life. But I felt her body tense. Felt the shame coiled inside her like a living thing.

That was Julia then. Before the power. Before the armor. Before the Cyprus trip.

Her biggest sexual regret—even now.

And maybe that's why this week with me mattered so much.

Because here, in this cocoon of sex and skin and tenderness, she wasn't being used. She wasn't performing. She was being held. And it started to change something deep inside her—something that had been broken in the back seat of that Uber.

I didn't tell her about the Nigerian girl that morning. I knew she'd be jealous. She always was. But in truth, we both had slutty chapters. That's what made us human.

And I didn't realize it at the time, but her emotional walls were softening. The sugar-baby detachment was melting. She wanted to stay in bed forever—not because it was safe, but because it was sacred.

The Uber driver had taught her she was worthless.

I was teaching her she was worth everything.

Neither of us knew it yet.

What I didn't know: In Budapest three months later, I'd tell her she needed to see other guys. That I couldn't be her future. I thought I was setting her free. She felt rejected. Pushed into other men's arms. The ice dam I didn't know existed would burst. Benoît at a Christmas party. The Greek in Athens—blood on white sheets. An Irishman she'd kiss in a crowded bar after asking: "Do you not want to do anything to me?" Each one teaching her she was wanted. But none teaching her she was worth everything. That lesson died in Cyprus.

## Tits Out: The Red Dress

Toward the end of the week, she got a message from girlfriends—they were also in Paphos. She lit up. She loved going out with other women. Loved dressing up. Loved being seen with them, instead of alone or on a man's arm.

That night: short, tight red dress. Cleavage deep. Heels high. She'd later call it "tits out"—her and Hillary's private term for going fully femme, fully unfiltered.

She went to a bar in the old town—a raised plateau above the coast, narrow Greek streets, good music, cheap drinks. I didn't go. She needed the lightness of her girls.

She came back around eleven. Tipsy. Sparkling. High from male attention, but untouched by shame.

She walked in, kissed me, pressed herself against me. I reached for the twins.

Then she turned around.

Held onto the edge of the kitchen island.

Pulled up the red dress.

Dropped her panties.

"Fuck me," she whispered.

And I did.

From behind. Doggystyle. Heels kicked off. Shorts dropped. We cycled through our favorite patterns—deep and slow, clit play, tip teasing, back in again. Her moaning louder each time. She knew what was coming. I knew too.

The squirt came hard. Explosive. She soaked her thighs, my balls, the floor.

She laughed and ran upstairs for a shower, still dripping. I grabbed a kitchen towel, wiped the tiles, threw it in the washer.

That night, she didn't say "I love you."

But her body did.

Later, when she went full nympho, she'd recreate this scene with others. The Spaniard—four hours with a camera. The American—an Ericeira fuckfest. Same tits-out confidence, same kitchen-island angle, same explosive finish. But never the same meaning. Some body language you only speak once.

## Flashforward: The Moment Everything Changed

Flashforward.

Months later, in a freezing November Budapest, she would isolate herself in a small Airbnb, waiting for me. Her love had turned heavy. Claustrophobic.

I told her she needed to see other guys. That I couldn't be her future. That I was an impossible dream. We were an impossible love.

But I wasn't pushing her away. I was trying to protect her—from the loneliness, from the self-doubt, from loving me too much. I was trying to give her a future I couldn't offer.

She didn't see it that way.

She felt rejected. Pushed to others. Like a pimp had just fucked his whore… then sent her to a hotel room for the next man.

It didn't happen immediately. But that was the moment she stopped being a nun. And started becoming a nympho.

Not yet the revenge sex she'd later perfect with Zurich, Irish, or Charles.

But the trigger.

The wound that would never quite heal.

Because what I called protection, she experienced as abandonment. What I thought was selfless love, she felt as rejection. I was trying to set her free. She wanted to be kept.

And the cruel irony? The more I pushed her toward other men, the more she clung to me. The more I told her I couldn't be her future, the more desperately she tried to make me her present.

That hadn't happened yet.

For now—for this one sacred week—she was still innocent. Still soft. Still mine.

Cyprus was when she fell in love.

And I… was too blind to see it.

Too scared to hold it.

Too certain I would destroy it.
