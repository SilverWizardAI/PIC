## Return from Ancona

It was almost 4pm when we got back to the ship from that dull, forgettable tour of Ancona — the kind of throwaway stop cruise companies toss into the itinerary just to fill the days before the big Venice finale.

We'd wandered cobbled streets that smelled of espresso and salt air, peered into crumbling Romanesque churches where old women lit candles for the dead, licked stracciatella gelato in a sleepy piazza where pigeons outnumbered tourists. We snapped photos we'd never look at again — her in that white sundress with the spaghetti straps, me squinting into the Adriatic sun, both of us performing the pantomime of a couple who hadn't nearly destroyed each other three days earlier in Santorini.

But the important thing was: we hadn't argued.

We hadn't fallen apart. Not like we did in Mykonos, where she'd stormed off the beach in tears, leaving me alone with the white sand and the certainty that I'd lost her. Not like Santorini, where the rupture had been so violent I still didn't understand how we'd survived it.

This Friday had started soft — tender, even. No sex. Just the warmth of two naked bodies slowly rediscovering each other in sleep, like continents drifting back together after tectonic separation.

Cuddles. Fingers tracing familiar skin — the curve of her hip, the small of her back, the ridge of her collarbone where my thumb knew to rest.

She laid her flawless 25-year-old Black leg over my taut, biohacked 73-year-old white body like it was still her favorite place to rest. Like the 48-year gap between us didn't matter. Like the shame and rage and fear that had detonated in Greece were just weather we'd weathered.

There was no shame that morning. No explosions. No accusations about Budapest, or the conversation that changed everything, or the ice dam that burst when I told her to see other guys.

Just the flicker of a wick being re-lit.

We showered together — her back against my chest, water running over her breasts, my hands on her stomach, both of us silent and careful, like we were handling something fragile and irreplaceable.

We dressed. We stepped off the ship as if the Santorini rupture had never happened.

And in a way, it hadn't.

Not yet.

The real explosion was still hours away. But I didn't know that. All I knew, walking back up the gangway with her hand in mine, was that we'd made it through another day without breaking.

And that felt like victory.

## Close Your Eyes

Back in the cabin now, she disappeared into the bathroom without a word.

I lay on the bed under the big window, arms behind my head, legs sprawled, watching the late afternoon sunlight paint gold across the white sheets. The cabin was small but bright — floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the Adriatic, the kind of luxury that makes you forget you're trapped on a floating mall with 3,000 strangers.

I felt something I hadn't felt in weeks — safety.

That fragile illusion that we were okay again. That the cuddles this morning meant something. That maybe this cruise — and the missed funeral, the one my family would never forgive me for — had been the right move after all.

That maybe, just maybe, the wounds were healing.

I heard the shower run. Then stop. The rustle of fabric. The click of something being unzipped.

Minutes passed.

Then she called out from behind the door, her voice playful and commanding at once.

"Close your eyes."

I smiled, my heart already climbing.

"Why?"

"Because I said so."

So I did.

I closed my eyes and felt the cabin shrink to just sound and anticipation. The creak of the bathroom door opening. The whisper of silk against skin. The click-click-click of her heels on the tiled floor — sharp, deliberate, coming closer.

And then: nothing.

Just the beat of my own heart, climbing faster now.

Just the hum of the ship's engines, deep and rhythmic beneath us.

Just the knowledge that she was standing there, somewhere close, watching me with my eyes closed, vulnerable and waiting.

The power dynamic had shifted. She knew it. I knew it.

This was her show.

I felt her weight on the bed — a knee pressing into the mattress beside my hip. The heat of her body near mine. The scent of her — vanilla body lotion, the faint musk of her skin, something floral I couldn't name.

She leaned down and whispered into my ear, her breath hot and soft.

"Now open."

I opened.

And forgot how to breathe.

She was standing at the foot of the bed in full Victoria's Secret — turquoise lace barely clinging to her glowing, flawless skin. The color made her dark complexion luminous, like she was lit from within.

Her signature Double D breasts swelled under a web of soft fabric, so delicate it looked like sea mist spun into lingerie. The cups were sheer enough to show the dark circles of her areolas, the hardness of her nipples pressing against the lace.

Long satin straps hung loosely down her sides, tied into gentle bows at her hips — like gift-wrapped sin. Like something you unwrap slowly, savoring every second before you destroy it.

Her hips. That perfect hourglass curve that no amount of gym work could fake — it was genetic, ancestral, the kind of body that made men stupid.

Her smooth, dark thighs shimmering under the golden cabin light, the gap between them just visible, the lace barely covering the apex where they met.

And those eyes… serious, playful, powerful. She wasn't asking if I liked it. She was daring me not to.

She wasn't just wearing lingerie. She was claiming it. Claiming me. Claiming the entire goddamn room.

"You like?"

I didn't answer. I couldn't. My mouth had forgotten how to form words.

She already knew.

She could see it in the way my cock was already straining against my shorts. In the way my hands gripped the sheets. In the way I looked at her like she was the only woman who'd ever existed.

And in that moment, she was.

## The Goddess I Created

She crawled onto the bed like a panther — slow, controlled, every movement deliberate.

She kissed me slow at first… then faster — her tongue soft and sweet, then insistent, demanding. Her lips tasted like mint and something darker, addictive. She bit my lower lip gently, then harder, testing how much I could take.

Her hands were everywhere — in my hair, on my chest, sliding down my stomach, tracing the ridges of muscle I'd built over six years of biohacking my way back from 67-year-old defeat to 73-year-old reborn predator.

She rubbed herself against my dick through the lace, hips grinding in slow circles, building friction, building heat, building my anticipation until I was shaking. I could feel the wetness of her through the fabric — hot, slick, ready.

"Remember Ayia Napa?" she whispered, her mouth at my ear.

I did.

I would never forget.

A week alone in Cyprus while I was stuck in Lisbon. Her awakening. The moment she discovered her power.

The Queen of Ayia Napa, I'd called her when she came back. And it wasn't hyperbole.

She'd been crowned there — by Zurich, the Swiss alpha who'd claimed her first, by the devoted barmen and bouncers who competed for her attention, by the drunk pretty girls in their skimpy club outfits who looked like children next to her.

But none of them came close to Julia in her sexy, elegant dresses — the ones we'd designed together, cut low enough to make men lose their train of thought, tight enough to show every curve — crowned always by those impossible Double Ds that defied gravity and logic.

She'd gone to Cyprus as a girl.

She came back as a goddess.

And she never went back to being the innocent girl with braids who came too hard the first time I touched her over three years ago. The one who'd cried in my arms after her first orgasm, overwhelmed and ashamed and grateful all at once.

I created this goddess.

I'd unlocked her. Taught her how her body worked. Shown her what pleasure felt like when a man actually gave a fuck about her instead of just using her as a warm hole. I'd freed her from Catholic shame and African conservatism and the trauma of every man who'd failed her before me.

And once awakened, she became unstoppable.

Ayia Napa was just the beginning. After that came Benoît the French dancer, the Tantric cult leader who tried to break her, the parade of younger men with bigger dicks who thought they could own her because I'd told her to explore, to play, to discover what she wanted.

I'd opened the door.

I just didn't realize I'd never be able to close it.

"Slide up on my face," I said, my voice rough.

And she did — peeling the turquoise lace to the side, straddling my head, lowering herself until her pussy was hovering just above my mouth, close enough that I could smell her, taste the air around her.

I gripped her thighs and pulled her down.

Slid my tongue up her slit — slow, deliberate, from bottom to top.

Then found her clit — soft, swollen, alive under my tongue.

I remember her taste — sweet and sharp and addictive, like honey cut with salt and something darker, something animal and raw that made my cock ache.

I remember the way her thighs shook when I sucked her clit into my mouth.

The way her hands gripped the headboard so hard her knuckles went pale.

The way her breath turned to moans and her moans to shouts and her shouts to something wordless and primal as I owned her orgasm with my mouth.

She came hard — thighs clamping around my head, back arching, hips grinding against my face like she was trying to fuck my tongue deeper, harder, more.

Then I slid her down.

Arched my back.

And plunged into her.

She gasped — that sharp intake of breath that always came the first time I entered her, no matter how wet she was, no matter how ready. The stretch. The fullness. The way my cock hit angles no one else could find.

She rode me hard — first with her 'twins' in my hands, those impossible breasts spilling over my palms, heavy and soft and perfect. Both nipples in my mouth, one after the other, sucking and biting until she whimpered.

That was the switch. The magic one.

The one no one else had found.

Not Mr. Tantric, who tried to turn her into a submissive sex toy for his sacred squirt sessions and left her feeling violated and used.

Not the Italian with his monster 10-inch cock that nearly tore her apart and left her bleeding and traumatized.

Not Spanish, who fucked her for four hours straight in that Lisbon apartment and filmed her bouncing tits as she rode him, then ghosted her the next day.

Not the American surfer who pummelled her for two straight days in the Ericeira fuckfest — squirt after squirt after squirt — but couldn't string more than three words together between orgasms.

All of them were 40 years younger than me.

All of them had thick 9-inch-plus dicks to my respectable 7.

All of them were conventionally handsome in ways my 73-year-old face would never be again.

But none of them found that switch.

I did.

And I knew exactly what it unlocked.

## Doggy: Unwrapping the Last Gift

She squatted now, feet planted on either side of my hips, fucking herself on me with complete control — rising until just the tip of me was inside her, then dropping hard, taking me to the cervix, over and over. She held my hands for balance, our fingers interlaced, her eyes locked on mine.

The power in her thighs was incredible. The way she moved — not bouncing like a porn star, but rolling her hips, grinding, rotating, finding the angles that made her gasp.

Then I flipped her.

Pulled her off me, turned her around, laid her on her knees at the foot of the bed facing the window. The Adriatic stretched out beyond the glass, endless and blue and indifferent to what was happening in this cabin.

Of the 100+ women I've had in my life — and the 50+ since my biohacking rebirth at 67, when I'd transformed from overweight defeat into something dangerous and vital — none of them did doggy quite like Julia.

She kept her legs close together, always. Said it felt more intense that way. Maybe it was the deep ridges of her G-spot, front and back — whatever it was, the position made her wild.

I peeled the turquoise lace back slowly — from her hips first, then her waist, then up her spine — like unwrapping the last gift I'd ever get. The fabric caught on her skin, damp with sweat, and I had to ease it over her shoulders, her arms, finally lifting it over her head and tossing it aside.

Her skin gleamed in the golden light — dark and flawless and perfect, every muscle defined, every curve exactly where it should be.

Her ass arched, that impossible curve from lower back to tailbone to the swell of her cheeks. She looked back at me once over her shoulder, hair spilling across her face, and smirked — that look that said *I know exactly what I'm doing to you*.

And then I was inside her.

Doggy. Slow at first. Then fast.

Then teasing — pulling almost all the way out, making her whimper and push back, trying to reclaim me.

Deep thrusts that made her cry out. Then slow withdrawal, watching her squirm and moan and beg without saying a word.

My hands on her hips, gripping hard enough to leave marks. Then on her shoulders, holding her in place. Then one hand sliding around to cup a breast — heavy, soft, the nipple hard against my palm.

I let her fuck herself for a while, my hips still, just letting her rock back and forth on me at her own pace.

She loved that — that it wasn't submission, but choice. That she could take what she wanted, how she wanted it.

Her rhythm built — faster, harder, more desperate — and I could feel her getting close, the way her pussy tightened, the way her breath went ragged.

Then I took over.

Grabbed her hips again. Pulled her back hard onto me with every thrust.

Deep. Cervix-deep. The kind of depth that bordered on pain but somehow wasn't.

She gasped. Tightened. Her whole body went rigid.

I knew she was coming.

But she was trying not to squirt — holding it back, clenching, fighting her own body.

"Bathroom," she said, her voice strained.

I knew what that meant.

She needed the floor. The tiles. The permission to let go completely without flooding the bed.

I pulled out.

She stumbled to her feet, legs shaking, and I followed her into the small bathroom.

## The Bathroom Floor

I bent her over the sink.

Hands on the mirror — her palms flat against the glass, leaving prints. Legs apart, just wide enough. Eyes locked on mine in the reflection.

The bathroom was tiny — white tile, harsh fluorescent light, the scent of sex and vanilla lotion mixing with steam from our earlier shower. We barely fit. But that's what made it perfect.

No room to escape. No room to hold back.

I slid into her again from behind — standing, controlled, relentless. The angle was different here, sharper, hitting spots that made her whimper.

"Now you can relax," I whispered, my mouth at her ear. "Let it go."

She nodded, our eyes still locked in the mirror.

I could see everything — the way her face shifted from tension to surrender, the way her breasts swayed with every thrust, the way her mouth opened in a silent moan.

I angled upward — thrusting from below, targeting the front wall of her pussy where the ridges of her G-spot were deepest.

Then I slowed.

Halfway in, I reached around to her clit.

Found the edge — that outer-inside spot where the hood met the shaft, the place that sent her into orbit every single time.

I massaged it gently at first, then with more pressure, circles and figure-eights and rhythms I'd learned over three years of mapping her body like a sacred text.

And she lost it.

First squirt — hot and sudden, spraying down my thighs, soaking my legs and the floor between us.

"Oh god," she gasped.

Second squirt — stronger, more forceful, her whole body convulsing, her pussy clenching and releasing in waves. It soaked my balls, ran down the inside of her thighs, pooled on the white tiles.

I didn't stop. Kept the pressure on her clit, kept the slow deep thrusts, kept her right on the edge where pleasure turned into something overwhelming and transformative.

Third squirt — full-body, flooding the tiles, splashing against the shower door. Steam rose from the puddle, the heat of her mixing with the cool air.

She collapsed forward against the sink, her legs giving out, but I caught her — one arm around her waist, holding her up, still inside her.

She was trembling. Laughing. Crying. All at once.

Her breath came in ragged gasps, her whole body shaking with aftershocks.

"I can't—" she started, but couldn't finish.

"I know," I said.

We were soaked. The floor was soaked. My knees were soaked. The towels on the rack had somehow gotten splashed.

And the scent of sex hung thick in the air — primal, animal, undeniable.

I pulled out slowly, carefully, and she turned in my arms and buried her face in my chest.

We stood there for a long moment, breathing together, her heart hammering against mine.

This was the intimacy that terrified her. Not the sex. Not the squirting. But this — the afterwards, the vulnerability, the way I held her like she was something precious instead of just a body to fuck.

This was what she'd run from in Budapest, when I'd told her to see other guys.

This was what she'd found in Ayia Napa with Zurich — and then again with Benoît, with Tantric, with all of them.

The escape from being loved.

But right now, in this tiny bathroom, she wasn't running.

She was here.

Trembling and naked and mine.

## Hours Before She Vanished

I held her. Naked. Breathing. Spent.

We'd moved back to the bed somehow — stumbled there on shaking legs, collapsed onto the sheets still damp with sweat and effort. The afternoon light was fading now, the Adriatic turning from blue to gold to something darker.

For a few minutes, I believed it again.

That I had her. That we were back. That the sex had healed what words couldn't. That the goddess I'd created would stay mine because I was the only one who truly understood her, who knew the switch, who could make her come and squirt and fall apart and feel safe all at once.

I was so fucking stupid.

Little did I know… just hours later, the dresses we'd created together — those elegant, sexy designs we'd sketched and shopped for and hemmed in my apartment — would be worn in a rooftop photoshoot on this very ship.

First for me. For my camera. For the portfolio I was building of her as a model, an influencer, a brand.

Then for someone else.

For eyes I didn't know about. For a future I wasn't part of.

And the girl I'd turned into a goddess — the one I'd freed from shame and Catholic guilt and every boyfriend who'd failed her before me — the one who could win any heart, command any room, make any man stupid with want —

She would win a new heart.

A richer one. A younger one. One that could offer her the world I couldn't.

And she would be offered everything. The escape from her Angolan poverty. The visa she desperately needed. The life of luxury she'd only tasted in brief moments with me.

On one condition:

That she'd abandon me.

Immediately.

No goodbye. No explanation. No closure.

Just gone.

We never had another dinner together in the dining room, where we'd laughed over pasta and cheap wine just two nights before.

She never came back that night. After the photoshoot, after she'd changed into the white dress I loved, after she'd smiled at my camera one last time — she vanished.

And at 2:07am, alone in the cabin we'd shared, I got the WhatsApp.

*"I'm not coming back. Don't look for me. This is over."*

Then she blocked me.

And she was gone.

The goddess I'd created had found someone who wanted her more than I could afford to keep her.

And I was left with nothing but the scent of vanilla lotion on the pillows and the memory of her squirting on the bathroom floor just hours before she became someone else's.

The ice dam I'd cracked in Budapest had finally shattered completely.

And the flood drowned me.
