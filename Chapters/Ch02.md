## Scene 1: Morning: The Empty Bed (C2 Expansion)

The morning light hit the curtains like a whisper.

Soft. Cruel.

Like nothing had happened.

Like everything hadn't changed.

I was alone.

I'd woken to the hollow silence of a cabin that used to hold two heartbeats, two breathing bodies, two futures tangled together. Now there was just me and the ghost of vanilla lotion on the pillow beside mine.

Her side of the bed was empty, the white sheet tangled like a question mark where her body used to be. The indentation of her head still visible in the pillow. The mattress still warm where she'd slept — or pretended to sleep — before disappearing into someone else's life.

No note. No sound. No trace — except for the faint scent of her skin, that mix of cocoa butter and something sweet I could never name, lingering in the air like an accusation.

I stood up slowly, stiff from a night of twisted sleep and heartbreak, my 73-year-old body protesting every movement. The biohacking had made me vital, strong, capable of fucking a 25-year-old goddess into oblivion — but it couldn't protect me from this.

The ache in my chest that had nothing to do with cardiovascular health.

The weight in my lungs that no breathing exercise could fix.

I walked to the cabin window and pulled back the curtain, squinting against the Adriatic sun.

And there it was.

The skyline of Venice rising gently behind a shimmering sea — all terracotta roofs and bell towers and ancient elegance, indifferent to human suffering.

And cutting across the calm like a blade, a small private launch heading toward shore, leaving a white wake that looked like a scar across blue skin.

Onboard, him — the Italian — in a white linen suit and sunglasses, like a cliché with power. One hand on the wheel, the other draped casually over the seat beside him.

And next to him, still in the simple white dress from last night — the one that clung to her hips and showed the curve of her breasts, the one I'd watched her slip into before she walked out the door and never came back — her.

Julia. My goddess. My creation. My failure.

Not waving. Not turning. Not looking back toward the cruise ship where I stood watching her disappear.

Just gone.

She hadn't just abandoned me.

She'd abandoned her clothes — the red dress from the photoshoot still folded on the chair, her heels scattered across the cabin floor like evidence of a crime.

Her past — the three and a half years of passion and pain and impossible love that we'd built together.

Her lover — the 73-year-old man who'd unlocked her, transformed her, created the goddess who was now too powerful to need him.

For his world.

The indecent proposal. The multimillion-dollar contract. The promise of escape from Angolan poverty and visa struggles and the uncertainty of loving a man who would die decades before her.

The price?

Never see me again.

And she'd said yes.

The heartless, unreachable goddess I had built.

I pressed my forehead against the glass and watched the launch grow smaller, smaller, until it was just a white dot against the Venice skyline.

Until she was gone.

Really, truly gone.

And I was left holding the ruins of a prophecy I'd spoken into existence: *You have to find someone else. Someone younger. Someone who can give you the future I can't.*

She'd listened.

And now I was alone in a cabin that smelled like her skin, surrounded by her dresses, holding the memory of her squirting on the bathroom floor just twenty-four hours ago.

Before everything ended.
## Scene 2: Flashback: The Rooftop Photoshoot (C2 Expansion)

[FLASHBACK: THE PHOTOSHOOT — 18 HOURS EARLIER]

It was perfect.

The sun hanging low over the Adriatic, painting everything gold. The sea stretching to infinity, calm and blue and indifferent. The upper deck transformed into an impromptu runway, the cruise ship's professional photographer setting up lights and reflectors like we were shooting for Vogue.

Julia in her own dress — the red one we'd designed together over late-night sketches in my Lisbon apartment, the one we'd spent weeks perfecting.

The corset top pulled so tight it nearly spilled her nipples, the boning creating that impossible hourglass that made men forget their own names. The deep front slit ending just below the red lace of her panties — a flash of forbidden when she moved, when she sat, when she crossed her legs. High black patent leather heels that made her legs look endless.

Designed by her. Financed by me. Sewn by a factory in Guangzhou. Delivered to the ship just days earlier, carried aboard like a secret weapon.

She descended onto that deck like a queen returning to claim her court.

Her Black sisters — three gorgeous women in their own right, all curves and confidence and African royalty — flanked her like a royal guard. But even they faded into background when Julia walked into the light.

She glowed.

Not makeup. Not the golden hour sun. Just her — that luminous dark skin, those impossible Double Ds testing the limits of physics and fabric, that face that could stop traffic in any city on earth.

I watched from a few paces back — proud… and invisible.

The creator watching his creation claim the world.

The crowd noticed her.

Everyone noticed her.

Conversations stopped mid-sentence. Wine glasses paused halfway to lips. Men turned like sunflowers tracking the sun. Women stared with that mix of envy and admiration and calculation.

The cruise ship's official photographer — a Greek guy in his thirties with expensive gear and that cocky photographer swagger — took control immediately. He directed. She obeyed.

But it wasn't submission. It was collaboration. She knew exactly what she was doing.

Leaning back against a deck chair, one leg extended, the slit falling open just enough. Looking over the ship's railing at the sea, wind catching her hair, profile perfect against the golden sky. Sitting on the edge of a lounge chair, knees together, leaning forward just enough that the corset created cleavage that could sink ships.

Turning. Laughing. Serious. Playful. Sultry. Innocent.

She had a hundred faces and every one of them was devastating.

Phones came out. A wave of male attention rippled across the deck — guys pretending to check their email while angling for the perfect shot. Female envy sharp enough to cut.

Even a round of soft applause when she struck a particularly perfect pose.

She loved it.

She owned it.

This was what I'd promised her. What I'd trained her for. The moment when the world recognized what I'd seen from the first time I'd touched her three years ago — that she was extraordinary.

That's when he appeared.

The Italian. Late 50s, maybe early 60s — hard to tell behind the designer sunglasses that probably cost more than my rent. White linen suit, perfectly tailored, loose enough to hide the slight belly but fitted enough to show money. Cream silk shirt unbuttoned just enough to show gold chain. Heavy Rolex Daytona on his wrist, the kind that costs six figures. Handmade leather loafers, no socks.

A bit of a belly, yes. Thinning hair combed back with expensive product. Not conventionally handsome.

But moneyed. Confident. Immaculately dressed. The kind of man who moves through the world knowing doors open before he reaches them.

He walked straight to her — not hesitating, not asking permission, just claiming space like he owned it.

Whispered something in her ear, close enough that I could see her tense, then smile.

She laughed — that musical sound I loved, the one that meant she was flattered and interested and calculating all at once.

He seemed to ask something. She answered, her lips moving in what looked like numbers.

It looked like a phone number.

Or a price.

Then he was gone — walking away with the casual confidence of a man who gets what he wants, disappearing back into the crowd like a shark sliding back into deep water.

I only found out afterward what he'd said.

Back in the cabin an hour later, high on adrenaline and success, she was stripping out of the red dress, peeling the corset away from her skin, breathing deep for the first time in an hour.

I kissed her — tasting her lip gloss, her sweat, her triumph.

"You were incredible up there," I said. "What did that guy in the white suit say to you?"

She brushed it off with a gentle lie, her eyes not quite meeting mine.

"Oh… nothing special. Just said I looked very beautiful. I said thank you."

Then came the text.

Her phone buzzed on the bed. She glanced at the screen, tensed for half a second, then smiled and typed quickly.

"I'm just going for one last drink with the Black girls before dinner," she said, already pulling off the red dress completely, reaching for the short tight white one hanging in the closet. "Will meet you in the restaurant at 9:30, okay?"

The white dress — soft jersey fabric that clung to every curve, deep V-neck that showed the valley between her breasts, hem that ended mid-thigh, bare legs that went on forever. Black heels again. Hair down. Minimal makeup.

Effortlessly devastating.

She kissed my cheek — quick, distracted, already gone in her mind.

And walked out the door.

I stood there in the empty cabin, surrounded by the scattered evidence of the photoshoot — the red dress draped over the chair, the heels kicked off in opposite corners, her makeup scattered across the bathroom counter.

I didn't know it then, but I'd never be this close to her again.

The goddess had been seen.

And someone else was making an offer I couldn't compete with.
## Scene 3: The Lonely Dinner (C2 Expansion)

[FLASHBACK: THE LONELY DINNER]

9:30 came and went.

Then 10.

Then 10:30.

I sat alone at our usual restaurant table — the one by the railing on Deck 8, the one we'd claimed on the first night of the cruise, the one where we'd laughed over cheap Chianti and overcooked pasta and pretended we weren't broken from the Santorini rupture.

The table for two that was now just for one.

The sea silent beneath us, dark and infinite and indifferent. The ship cutting through it with mechanical precision, carrying me toward Venice and away from everything I'd thought was healing.

A single candle burning slowly between two wine glasses. One full of red. One empty, untouched, waiting for someone who would never arrive.

When the waiter came over — Roberto, the young Italian who'd served us every night, who'd learned to bring her sparkling water without ice and extra bread — he looked at the empty chair with barely concealed concern.

"Is Julia joining you tonight?"

I smiled. Lied.

"She's a bit sick. Just resting in the cabin."

He smiled politely. But he knew.

You can always tell when someone knows you're lying. The way their eyes soften with pity. The way they nod too quickly, too eager to let you keep your dignity.

"Ah, I'm sorry to hear. Should I bring her some soup? Some crackers?"

"No, no. She just needs rest. Thank you."

He retreated, but I could feel him watching me from the server station, whispering to the other waiters. The old man whose beautiful girlfriend wasn't coming to dinner.

He came back twice more.

Asked if I needed anything. If I was okay. If I wanted dessert, coffee, anything to justify my continued presence at a table for two.

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't eat. I couldn't speak without my voice cracking.

The pasta sat untouched on my plate, congealing into a pile of carbs and regret.

I was holding back tears with the strength of a man who knew he was being left again.

Not like the first wife, who'd left with the kids and the house and half my pension.

Not like the second wife, who'd discovered I was unfixable and walked away with her sanity.

Not like the third, who'd simply stopped loving me and had the decency to say it.

This was different.

This was the goddess I'd created walking away because I'd done my job too well.

After dinner — after pushing food around a plate for an hour, after finishing both wine glasses, after paying the bill with shaking hands — I searched.

The spa. The lower bars. The upper deck. The nightclub. The buffet that stayed open until midnight.

Every place we'd danced, laughed, kissed, fought.

Every corner of this floating prison where we'd tried to pretend we could survive the 48-year gap.

I checked them all.

No Julia.

The ship felt enormous and claustrophobic at once. Three thousand passengers and I was looking for one 25-year-old Black woman in a white dress, like searching for a specific star in a galaxy.

Eventually, I found her Black sisters — still together in the Deck 11 bar, laughing over cocktails, beautiful and carefree and everything Julia should have been if I hadn't complicated her life.

I walked toward them, hopeful, desperate, trying not to look like a man unraveling.

But they looked confused when they saw me.

"Hey," one of them said — Michelle, the one from Zimbabwe with the dancer's body. "Where's Julia? We thought she was with you."

My stomach dropped.

"She said she was meeting you for drinks. After the photoshoot."

They exchanged glances.

"She never showed," another one said — Ayana, the Nigerian with the PhD and the perfect skin. "We were expecting her. She texted us around 7 saying she'd meet us here after she changed. We waited until almost 9. We thought she changed her mind and went to dinner with you instead."

They looked at me with growing concern.

"Is everything okay?"

I couldn't answer.

My throat had closed. My chest was tight. My hands were shaking.

If she wasn't with them. And she wasn't with me.

Then where the fuck was she?

"I'm sure it's fine," I managed, my voice hollow. "Probably just... got tired. I'll check the cabin."

But I didn't believe it.

I turned.

And walked away, trying to keep my pace normal, trying not to run, trying not to let them see me falling apart.

Back to the cabin.

Shattered. Destroyed.

Broken again.

The door opened to darkness and silence. I flipped the light switch, half-expecting to see her there, asleep in bed, some innocent explanation for the missed dinner.

But the cabin was empty.

Exactly as I'd left it.

I sat on the bed. Opened our shared suitcase, the big one with both our clothes tangled together. Tried to pack her things on her side, some desperate attempt to create order out of chaos, to prepare for whatever was coming.

I folded the red dress from the photoshoot — careful, precise, like it was sacred. Found one black heel under the bed, the other near the bathroom door. Her earrings on the shelf above the sink. Her makeup scattered across the counter.

All the evidence of a life lived together.

Where had she gone?

Had she fallen overboard? Was she hurt? Was the ship's security looking for her?

Had that fucking Italian done something to her?

Should I report her missing?

And then… at 2:07 a.m., as I sat on the bed surrounded by her things, my phone buzzed.

WhatsApp notification.

Julia.

And everything ended.
## Scene 4: 2am: For Me It's Over (C2 Expansion)

[TEXT MESSAGE – SHOWN EXACTLY]

**Julia**
*Saturday 2:07 AM*

*"My love…*

*I'm sorry. I can't come back.*

*You said you would make me a goddess, and you did.*

*Told me I could command any room, win any heart.*

*And I won a new heart this evening.*

*You always told me I could do it.*

*That our love was impossible.*

*That I had to look to my future. Find a younger man.*

*Well… he's not much younger.*

*But he made me an offer that could change everything.*

*He said he can make me a star — my clothes brand, my modelling career.*

*A $10M signed contract.*

*But only if I leave you behind.*

*I didn't plan this. It just happened.*

*Please don't hate me.*

*I still love you.*

*But I have to go.*

*You'll be contacted for my stuff.*

*Please pack my dresses and take them home.*

*That's my last request.*

*— J"*

---

I sat on the bed, phone in hand, reading the message once. Twice. Three times.

Like if I read it enough times, the words would rearrange themselves into something that didn't destroy me.

But they didn't.

Every word was a knife.

*You said you would make me a goddess, and you did.*

Yes. I did. I unlocked her. Taught her how her body worked. Freed her from Catholic shame and African conservatism. Showed her what power looked like when a woman understood her worth.

I'd done exactly what I set out to do.

And now she was using that power to leave me.

*You always told me I could do it.*

Budapest. That Saturday night after she'd squirted all over the hotel room floor. When I'd held her trembling body and whispered the truth she needed to hear: *You have to find someone else. Someone who can give you the future I can't.*

I'd meant it.

I'd thought I was being noble, selfless, preparing her for a life after me.

I didn't realize I was writing my own ending.

*A $10M signed contract.*

Ten million.

I'd given her orgasms. He was giving her a future.

I'd given her three and a half years of passion and pain and impossible love.

He was giving her everything I couldn't — security, stability, escape from poverty, a visa, a brand, a life that didn't depend on a 73-year-old man's biohacked longevity.

*But only if I leave you behind.*

The price.

The condition.

Never see me again.

And she'd said yes.

Without hesitation. Without fighting for us. Without even coming back to the cabin to say it to my face.

Just a WhatsApp message at 2am, sent from whatever hotel room or yacht or palace that Italian had taken her to.

*I still love you.*

The cruelest line of all.

Because I believed it.

She did love me. In her way. As much as a 25-year-old goddess could love the 73-year-old man who'd created her.

But love wasn't enough.

It was never enough against ten million dollars and the promise of everything she'd ever wanted.

*Please pack my dresses and take them home.*

Her last request.

Not "come find me."

Not "let's talk about this."

Not "I made a mistake."

Just: pack my clothes. Take them home. Remember me.

I sat on the bed, phone in hand, tears on my face for the first time in decades.

Furious. Betrayed. Grieving.

Furious at her for leaving. At the Italian for taking her. At myself for creating a goddess who didn't need me anymore.

Betrayed not by her, but by my own words, my own prophecy, my own fucking advice coming back to destroy me.

Grieving for the future we'd never have. For the mornings waking up tangled together. For the nights of squirting on bathroom floors and whispered confessions and impossible love that somehow kept surviving.

All of it. Gone.

I wanted to smash something.

I wanted to call her, text her, beg her to come back.

I wanted to scream.

I wanted to stop loving her.

Instead, I lay down on her side of the bed, buried my face in her pillow, breathed in the fading scent of vanilla lotion and cocoa butter.

And cried myself to sleep.

Alone in a cabin meant for two.

Surrounded by her dresses.

Holding the ruins of a love I'd built and destroyed with my own hands.
## Scene 5: White Dress, White Linen (C2 Expansion)

[BACK TO THE PRESENT – THE LAUNCH]

And now… the morning light.

The launch pulling away from the cruise ship, cutting across the Adriatic toward Venice, leaving a white scar across blue water.

White dress. White linen.

Her future. My failure.

She had done it.

She had finally done it.

She had become everything I told her she could be.

I'd always said it — in Budapest, in Lisbon, in every quiet moment after sex when she'd curl into my chest and whisper *what will happen to us?*

"You can't devote your life to me. I'm 48 years older. I won't live long enough to give you the future you deserve.

You have to find someone else to protect you, to lift you, to give you the security I can't promise.

Someone younger. Someone richer. Someone who can be there when I'm gone."

And now… she had.

After all the affairs — Benoît the French dancer, the Tantric cult leader, the Italian with his monster cock, Spanish who fucked her for four hours and filmed it, the American surfer in Ericeira.

After all the breakups — Mykonos, Santorini, the screaming fights in Lisbon apartments, the weeks of silence followed by desperate makeup sex.

After all the pain — her family's shame, her visa struggles, her poverty, her need to be worshipped and consumed and set free all at once.

She had finally found the man who would take care of her.

Or rather, the deal that would make her never need anyone to take care of her again.

Ten million dollars.

A modeling contract. A clothing brand with her name on it.

Escape from Angola. From visa anxiety. From the uncertainty of loving a man who would die decades before her.

She had followed my advice.

Lived my prophecy.

Fulfilled my creation.

And then she left me.

Because she didn't need me anymore.

I taught her to fly.

Showed her how powerful she was. How beautiful. How capable of commanding any room, winning any heart, making any man stupid with want.

I unlocked the goddess.

And she soared into someone else's sky.

I pressed my forehead against the cabin window and watched the launch disappear into the Venice skyline, taking her with it.

The white dress I'd watched her put on last night, thinking she was meeting her friends for drinks.

The white linen suit of a man who could offer her everything I couldn't.

The white wake across blue water that looked like the space between what we were and what we'd never be.

And I understood, finally, the full weight of what I'd done.

I'd built a goddess from a girl.

Freed her from shame and fear and Catholic guilt.

Taught her that her body was powerful, her sexuality sacred, her worth immeasurable.

Told her to find someone better.

And she did.

I'd done everything right.

And lost everything anyway.

Because love — real, impossible, age-gap love that defies logic and sense and every rational argument — doesn't survive prophecy.

It doesn't survive honesty.

It doesn't survive a man telling a woman: *you deserve better than me.*

Because eventually, she'll believe him.

And she'll find it.

The launch was gone now. Just Venice in the distance, all terracotta and bell towers and ancient elegance, indifferent to my suffering.

I turned away from the window.

Looked at the cabin — her dresses scattered across the chair, her heels on the floor, her makeup on the counter, her pillow still holding the shape of her head.

All the evidence of a goddess who'd been here.

And was now gone.

I picked up her red dress — the one from the photoshoot, the one we'd designed together, the one that had started this ending.

Folded it carefully.

And began to pack.

Her last request.

The only thing she'd asked of me.

Pack my dresses and take them home.

So I did.

Because even in destruction, even in abandonment, even in the wreckage of impossible love —

I would do anything for her.

Even let her go.
## Scene 6: This Is Our Story (C2 Expansion)

This is our story.

The 48-year age gap between a 73-year-old, biohacked Englishman with three ex-wives, five grown children, a history of failures and reinventions, and a desperate desire to matter again after retiring at 67 from a life that hadn't quite delivered what he'd promised himself…

And a beautiful, haunted, hunted 25-year-old Angolan girl.

A 10+ who didn't yet know it.

Torn between a manipulative, shaming, patriarchal family who saw her as property to be controlled — and the men who worshipped her like the goddess she was becoming.

This is the story of our 3.5 years together.

A cycle of passion and pain that neither of us could escape or survive but couldn't stop repeating.

Of erotic ecstasy — squirting on bathroom floors, nights that lasted until dawn, orgasms that made her cry and laugh and forget her own name.

And emotional abandonment — the weeks of silence, the affairs that broke us, the jealousy that poisoned us, the certainty that we were doomed from the start.

Of breakups and makeup sex. Of her lovers and mine — though hers cut deeper, lasted longer, mattered more.

Of the revenge sex of a girl who needed to be admired, desired, worshipped and consumed just to feel real.

A girl who'd been shamed by her family for being too sexual, too beautiful, too powerful.

Who'd been told by her mother that men only wanted one thing.

Who'd learned from her father that love was conditional, transactional, something you earned by being good enough.

But who was ultimately… haunted and hunted.

Haunted by the ghost of every man who'd used her, every family member who'd shamed her, every moment she'd felt less than worthy.

Hunted by men who saw her beauty and wanted to own it, control it, consume it, cage it.

This is the story of that impossible love.

The kind that makes no sense on paper — 48 years, three continents, two races, one desperation to make it work despite every rational argument against it.

And maybe it all began in Budapest.

In a hotel room on a Saturday night, after a day exploring the city, after dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Danube, after sex that left the bedroom floor soaked and both of us breathless.

When I held her trembling body and told her — gently, carefully, believing I was being noble:

"You must look after yourself.

You can't hide yourself away and just devote your life to me.

You have to think of yourself — your future, your security, your joy.

You'll need other men.

Stronger men. Younger men. Men who can give you what I can't.

And you'll have to learn how to avoid being exploited, controlled, shamed, manipulated.

This is your life.

I won't be able to help you for long.

You have to live it — your way, your rules, your joy."

She didn't cry.

She didn't argue.

She didn't tell me I was wrong, that we could make it work, that age didn't matter.

She just nodded.

And smiled.

And looked at me with those dark eyes that held more pain than any 25-year-old should carry.

And when she came back from a quiet Christmas in Angola — from two weeks with her family, from the shame and the judgment and the pressure to be someone she wasn't —

The nun became a revengeful nympho.

The girl I'd unlocked became a force of nature.

She took the space I'd left her while she was in Cyprus — while I was stuck in Lisbon, while we were "on a break," while I'd told her to explore, to discover, to find out what she wanted —

And began a string of wild, erotically-charged affairs.

Benoît, the French dancer who made her feel desired but not consumed.

The Tantric cult leader who tried to break her with sacred squirt sessions and left her feeling violated.

The Italian with his 10-inch monster cock who physically hurt her.

Spanish, who fucked her for four hours straight and filmed her bouncing tits.

The American surfer in Ericeira who gave her two days of relentless squirting but couldn't hold a conversation.

Affairs that culminated in her crowning as the Queen of Ayia Napa — a week alone in Cyprus where she discovered her power, her desirability, her ability to command any room and win any heart.

She left behind a trail of adoring ex-lovers.

Men who still texted her almost daily, even now.

Begging for another hit of her toxic love.

Sending pictures of their cocks, their bodies, their desperation.

Professing love, lust, obsession.

A series of wild romances I only glimpsed from exile in Lisbon — fragments she'd reveal in post-sex confessions, stories that made me hard and jealous and devastated all at once.

But that would soon be revealed to me… and to you… in haunting detail.

Every affair. Every betrayal. Every moment she chose someone else because I'd told her to.

This is that story.

The story of the goddess I created.

And the flood that drowned me when she became unstoppable.

The ice dam I'd cracked in Budapest had finally shattered completely.

And I was left standing in the wreckage, surrounded by her dresses, watching her disappear into Venice with a man who could give her everything I couldn't.

This is our story.

And it starts here.

In the ruins of impossible love.

With a 73-year-old man who taught a goddess to fly —

And watched her soar away.
