# Chapter 11: Christmas Family

## Scene 1: Christmas Eve Morning into Midday

She arrived a little after eleven, right on cue, her black winter coat flapping open in the December breeze, a soft smile warming her face. She'd dressed in something smart casual—tailored dark trousers that hugged her hips, a cream blouse with a subtle sheen, feminine but put-together. I don't remember the exact details. Only that she'd made an effort. We both had.

I'd trimmed my beard that morning, shaped it carefully in the bathroom mirror, second-guessing the angle of my jawline. Worn a clean, fitted charcoal shirt—the one she'd once said made my shoulders look good—and dark jeans that still fit properly. Put on my Zara cologne, the woody one, two sprays on the neck. The apartment smelled faintly of cinnamon and roasting meat. I'd already set the table: a cheap paper tablecloth in full Christmas cliché, red and gold swirls and holly leaves printed across it like a supermarket greeting card. Lots of red and white candles arranged in a cluster at the center. The wine was breathing on the counter—a Portuguese red from the Douro valley. The oven was warming, ticking quietly as it climbed to temperature. I was trying.

She kissed me gently at the door, her lips soft and cool from the outside air, and pressed a small box of Belgian chocolates into my hands. She made a little noise—something between approval and surprise—about how sweet everything looked. Her eyes scanned the room: the candles, the tablecloth, the wine glasses already set out. For a moment, it really did look sweet. Like maybe we could fake a tradition out of thin air.

We had a monster cut of meat to roast—something between a thick-cut steak and a rib roast, marbled with fat, wrapped in butcher paper. She'd texted her chef friend that morning to ask about timing. Over two hours in the oven, slow and low. While it cooked, we worked together in the small kitchen: peeling carrots with careful strokes, chopping sweet potatoes into rough cubes, preparing both mashed and roasted potatoes because we couldn't decide which we wanted more. We trimmed Brussels sprouts, cutting off the stems and pulling away the outer leaves, dropping them into a ceramic bowl.

I put on music—some jazz interlaced with Christmas classics, Coltrane bleeding into Nat King Cole—and she danced a little while stirring the gravy, her hips swaying, her bare feet padding on the tile floor. I mocked her for nearly burning the carrots, catching the smell of char just in time. She rolled her eyes and called me Mr. Gravy, her voice lilting and playful, the kind of voice she used when we weren't fighting.

It took about two and a half hours. We moved around each other like a couple that worked—passing knives, tasting sauces, adjusting salt and pepper without needing to ask. And when we finally sat down—full plates steaming in front of us, glasses of red Douro catching the candlelight, Christmas lights blinking softly in the hallway behind us—I remember thinking: *This is almost what it feels like to be chosen.*

We talked about random things. Laughed a little. Talked about food, friends, what we used to do at Christmas when we were kids. She told me about her family's tradition of opening one present on Christmas Eve, always pajamas. How her mom would make this elaborate seafood dish—bacalhau—and everyone would pretend to like it even though they all secretly wanted turkey. I told her about my childhood Christmases in England, cold and gray, wrapped presents stacked under a plastic tree, the smell of Brussels sprouts boiling too long in the kitchen.

She laughed at that. "You English and your boiled vegetables."

"It's a tradition," I said, grinning. "A terrible one."

She had to leave at 7pm to have another Christmas dinner with her family in Lisbon. Her *real* Christmas dinner, the one that counted. For a couple of hours, though, it was peaceful.

At some point after the dishes were cleared—plates stacked in the sink, gravy congealing on the stove—we ended up in the bedroom. I don't remember if we kissed much. I don't remember taking off her clothes, though I must have. I remember her lying back on the bed, her body soft and warm against the sheets, her eyes half-closed, letting me take care of things.

I used the black lipstick vibrator—her favorite, the sleek one that looked like designer makeup—between her legs while my tongue circled her nipples, teasing them into stiffness. Her body arched the way I knew it would, her breath catching in her throat, her hand reaching down to guide my wrist, pressing the vibrator harder against her clit. She came quietly, her thighs tensing, her back lifting off the bed for a long moment before she collapsed back into softness.

But I wasn't really in my body.

Something had broken in me since Ayia Napa. Since the threesomes. Since Irish. Since Paris. I was trying to be present, trying to focus on her pleasure, on the curve of her hip, the sound of her breathing. But my cock wouldn't stay hard for long. It would stiffen for a moment, then soften again, betraying me. I felt like a performer with stage fright—or worse, like a teenage boy again, back at university, nineteen years old, in love with a girl I'd just discovered was engaged to be married in the summer. Filled with guilt, unable to get hard, unable to breathe, unable to believe this was really happening.

It wasn't really sex. It was more like caretaking. Or damage control.

Afterward, we lay still for a while. I held her, my arm draped across her ribs, feeling the slow rise and fall of her breathing. She closed her eyes, her face peaceful, her body slack with release. I almost believed this was healing. Almost believed we were okay.

But even then, lying there in the soft December light filtering through the curtains, I knew we weren't.
## Scene 2: The Storm Before the Stillness

I don't remember how we got from that chaos to this quiet.

Maybe it was muscle memory. Or stubbornness. Or just the loneliness of the season pulling us back together like gravity. But as she stirred gravy and folded napkins into soft shapes, my mind wandered back to all the things we weren't talking about. The fights that had nearly ended us. The accusations that still hung in the air between every kiss, every "thank you," every careful moment of pretending we were okay.


There had been a moment in early November when I told her the truth—or at least, enough of it to make her jealous.

We were sitting on my couch, mid-afternoon, the November light pale and cold through the windows. She'd been pressing me for weeks. Asking in that casual way that wasn't casual at all: "So what do you do when I'm not here?" I'd deflected, dodged, changed the subject. But that day, I was tired. Tired of lying. Tired of pretending I wasn't exactly who she suspected I was.

So I told her.

The threesomes. Two Angolan girls. Not just once. Several Saturdays full of orgasms. Her place, sometimes. Mine, more often. Bodies tangled on my bed, on hers, in the shower. Hands and mouths and limbs rearranging in combinations that made sense in the moment and felt empty afterward.

She'd always suspected I was fucking other women. But this was the first time I said it out loud. And somehow, it landed harder than she expected. Harder than I expected.

She didn't cry. She didn't scream. She just... recalibrated.

Her face went still. Her eyes fixed on something past my shoulder. She nodded slowly, like she was processing a diagnosis. Then she stood up, gathered her bag, and left without another word. The door clicked shut behind her. No slamming. No drama. Just silence.

I sat there for a long time, staring at the spot where she'd been sitting, the couch cushion still warm from her body.

---

A week later, she started begging for Paris.

At first, I thought it was a distraction. A reset. She'd been talking about visiting her friends—the Nympho from Ayia Napa and the girl from Ayia Napa—for months. They'd rented a cheap apartment in the 18th arrondissement for a long weekend. She wanted to go. Needed to go, she said. Just three girls, some wine, some sightseeing. Nothing crazy.

But I knew better.

I said no. I raged, even. Told her it was a terrible idea. That sharing a cheap apartment with the Nympho—who had a reputation for chaos, for attracting men like flies to honey—would be a disaster. That men would be lining up outside the door to fuck her. That she wouldn't be safe with them in that neighborhood. That Paris was dangerous. That she would come back shaken, or broken, or worse.

"You don't trust me," she said, her voice flat.

"I don't trust *them*," I shot back.

"Same thing."

But she played the guilt card just right. Reminded me of the threesomes. Reminded me that I'd had my fun, my adventures, my Saturdays full of bodies. What about her? Didn't she deserve something, too? Didn't she deserve a weekend with her friends?

I folded. I always did.

---

And of course, it was exactly what I'd predicted.

Nympho chaos. Shitty neighborhood—Barbès, all graffiti and kebab shops and guys catcalling from doorways. No sleep. The three of them crammed into a tiny studio with one bed and a pull-out couch. A creepy guy burning his cigarette into her tights as she walked by on the street, leaving a small black hole in the fabric. She sent me a photo of it, her leg pale beneath the burnt nylon, her caption just: "WTF."

And then there was the club.

She told me about it later, casually, like it was nothing. A weird flirtation. A couple—both man and woman—trying to seduce her on the dance floor. The woman touched her arm, leaned in close, whispered something in French she didn't quite catch. The man watched from a few feet away, smiling. They exchanged Instagrams. A moment of temptation, she said. But no sex. Not even a kiss.

"I thought about it," she admitted. "For like, a second."

I didn't ask what stopped her.

Still, I felt her pull away from me a little more. Like she'd crossed some invisible line and couldn't quite find her way back.

---

And that's when Irish crept back in.

Kind. Obsessed. Harmless. She didn't even like him that much—or so she said. But he was available. Familiar. Present. He texted her every morning. Sent her memes. Offered to help with errands. Took her daughters to football practice when she was overwhelmed. The girls loved him. He wasn't a threat, not really.

Not until he became a placeholder.

When she went to his Irish football club Christmas dinner two weeks before this—mid-December, the week we were barely speaking—she came back glowing. All his mates had told her how stunning she was. How Irish was such a nice, gentle guy. That everybody loved him. Told Irish how lucky he was. Said he didn't deserve her. She soaked it up like sun on skin. And I watched her tan in someone else's light.

---

Then, a day or two later, the photo.

She was at my dinner table, talking about Irish. Casually, half-mocking him, half-defending him. I asked to see what he looked like. Just curious, I said. She handed me her phone without hesitation.

And I flinched.

A freckled, ginger man-bun. Pale, puffy features. Soft around the edges. Something in me recoiled so instantly I couldn't even hide it. I handed the phone back without a word, my face already betraying me. She stared at me like I'd slapped her.

"What?" she said, her voice sharp.

"Nothing."

"Bullshit. What?"

I shook my head. Tried to shrug it off. But she saw the truth of it written all over my face.

To her, it was jealousy. But it wasn't. It was revulsion. The thought of that man—in his dusty apartment with unwashed sheets—touching her. Lying on her. Inside her. I couldn't process it. Couldn't dress it up. And she saw it. All of it.

That's when it cracked open.

She stood up, her chair scraping against the floor. Gathered her things—her bag, her coat, her phone—without looking at me. Told me she didn't even recognize me anymore. That I wasn't the man she thought I was. That maybe I never was.

And when she got home, the messages came flooding in.

---

**Her, 11:47 PM:**
*"Would you have even dated Black girls when you were younger?"*

**Her, 11:52 PM:**
*"You're only with me because white girls won't have you."*

**Her, 12:03 AM:**
*"You just want a pretty Black girl you can fuck like some kind of colonial master."*

---

She'd just come from Irish's world—where the English were still colonizers, still villains of famine and empire. And now I was the villain, too. Not because of what I'd done, but because of how I'd looked at a photo. Because of the truth my face couldn't hide.

I tried to explain. Wrote her a thousand words she probably never read. Told her I'd never even known a Black girl growing up. That my desires were real, not some fetish. That I loved her. That I wasn't choosing her because white women rejected me—I was choosing her because she was her.

But it didn't matter.

She was spinning. Catastrophizing. Imagining a version of me that didn't exist—or maybe one that did, buried beneath everything I tried to be.

---

For a few days, we spiraled.

She couldn't sleep. She'd call me in the middle of the night, breathless, shaking, saying she wanted to vomit. Panic attacks. I coached her through them like a therapist—or like someone who'd had plenty of his own. Breathwork. Four in, hold for seven, eight out. Meditation prompts. A calm voice, steady and low, walking her back from the edge.

"You're okay," I'd say, lying in my own bed in the dark, phone pressed to my ear. "You're safe. Just breathe."

And slowly—so slowly—she came back.

Not all the way. But enough.

Enough to agree to Christmas Eve. Enough to show up at my door with chocolates and a soft smile. Enough to pretend, for a few hours, that we were whole.
## Scene 3: The Dinner Table and the Goodbye at 19:00

By the time we sat down to eat, everything looked perfect.

The meat was resting on the counter, a thick slab of beef still steaming from the oven, juices pooling darkly around the edges. The mash was smooth and buttery, whipped until it formed soft peaks. The sweet potatoes were crisped just right, caramelized at the edges, tender in the center. Brussels sprouts still bright green, not overcooked. Gravy thick and rich, glossy in the ceramic jug. We poured generous glasses of Douro red—deep, almost black in the candlelight—and toasted to something that felt almost like peace.

I watched her carve her steak with care, her knife cutting through the meat slowly, deliberately. She loaded her fork with a little bit of everything—sauce, sprout, carrot, potato—and chewed thoughtfully, her eyes half-closed in appreciation. She complimented the roast, the texture, the seasoning. I teased her about forgetting the cranberry sauce. She laughed, swatted my arm gently.

"You didn't buy any either," she said.

"Details," I replied.

We talked about families. About childhood Christmases. About who used to cook what, and how things had changed. And how things hadn't. She told me about her grandmother's tradition of making sweet bread—pão doce—on Christmas morning, the whole house smelling like cinnamon and sugar. How her cousins would fight over the biggest slice. How her mom always burned the edges but pretended it was intentional.

I told her about my mother's Christmas mornings in England, how she'd wake us up at dawn even though nothing was open, nothing was happening. How we'd sit in the cold living room in our pajamas, opening presents one by one, slowly, while the heating kicked in and the house smelled like instant coffee and disappointment.

She laughed at that. "You make it sound so depressing."

"It was depressing," I said. "But it was ours."

There was warmth. There was rhythm. But there was also time.

She checked the clock at 18:36. Subtle, but I saw it. Her eyes flicked to the wall, then back to her plate. Then again, at 18:42. A longer glance this time. She didn't want to leave. But she wasn't staying.

Her *real* Christmas dinner was waiting—her family, her daughters, the table set for twelve in her aunt's house in Lisbon. The one that counted. This was just the rehearsal. The preview. The warm-up act.

At 18:52, she pushed her chair back and sighed, like it was the end of a play. She stood slowly, stretching her arms above her head, her blouse riding up slightly to reveal the soft curve of her lower back. She walked to the bathroom to freshen up, left her lipstick print on the mirror—an accidental kiss aimed at no one—sprayed something floral in the hallway. When she came out, she was dressed like she hadn't just been in our bubble for the past eight hours. Coat on. Bag over her shoulder. Hair retouched.

I called the Uber while she gathered her things. The app said three minutes. She picked up her phone, her keys, the half-empty box of chocolates she'd brought. No drama. No stalling.

I walked her to the door.

A soft hug. Her body warm against mine, her head resting briefly on my shoulder. A light kiss—her lips barely grazing mine, soft and quick, like a bookmark. A quiet "thank you."

"I'll text when I get there," she said.

I smiled. "Okay."

And then she was gone.

The door clicked shut. I stood there for a moment, my hand still on the handle, listening to the faint sound of her footsteps descending the stairs. The Uber's engine humming outside. The soft thunk of the car door closing. Then silence.

I left the candles burning.
## Scene 4: Closing Reflection

I left the candles burning.

The table still set. The paper tablecloth spotted with gravy, wine, and memory. Plates stacked haphazardly in the sink, forks balanced precariously on the edge. I didn't clear it right away. Just walked through the house slowly, barefoot, the floor cool beneath my feet, like something might still be lingering in the walls. Like if I moved too quickly, I'd disturb whatever faint trace of her remained.

The scent of her perfume floated faintly in the hallway—floral, sweet, with something darker underneath, something I could never quite name. A smear of lipstick on the rim of her wine glass, deep burgundy against the glass's curve. One of her hair ties near the bathroom sink, a small black elastic coiled like a question mark. Traces. Always traces.

I poured myself another glass—the Douro, still half-full, still breathing—and sat by the window, looking out over Monte Estoril's quiet streets. A few apartment windows twinkled with lights, yellow and warm against the dark December sky. The occasional dog barked in the distance. Somewhere nearby, someone played Mariah Carey. *All I Want for Christmas Is You.* I hated how it made me feel. Hated the sincerity of it. The hopefulness.

My phone buzzed on the table.

**Her, 19:24:**
*"Just arrived. All good ❤️"*

It should have felt like a win. It didn't.

I sat there for a long time, watching the candles burn lower, the wax pooling and dripping down the sides in slow rivulets. The Christmas lights in the hallway blinked on and off, red and green and gold, casting soft shadows across the empty room. The house felt bigger without her in it. Emptier. Like it knew the difference between one person and two.

We'd called it our family of two. And for a few hours, we'd almost made it feel real. Almost made it feel like something that could survive. Like something that could last.

But families don't leave at 7pm.

Families don't check the clock mid-meal.

Families don't need to be resuscitated every weekend just to survive the next.

Still, I was grateful.

Grateful she came. Grateful she stayed as long as she did. Grateful that she kissed me at the door, that she let me hold her, that she didn't flinch when I touched her.

And grateful—above all—that for one cold December afternoon, we managed to pretend we were whole.

Even if we both knew we weren't.

I blew out the candles one by one, watching the smoke curl upward in thin gray ribbons. The smell of burnt wax filled the room. I left the table set, the plates in the sink, the wine glass with her lipstick still on the rim. I'd clean it tomorrow. Or the next day.

Tonight, I wanted to let it sit. Let the traces linger. Let the house remember that she'd been here.

Even if only for a few hours.

Even if it would never be enough.
## Scene 5: Postscript: A Family That Ends at New Year

After she left on Christmas Eve, we stayed in touch.

Little check-ins. Flirty emojis. A kiss here, a "Bom diaaa" there. She texted from the dinner table that night while I was still sitting alone in my apartment, candles burned down to stumps, the Christmas lights still blinking in the hallway.

**Her, 21:17:**
*"Got skincare gifts from my aunt. She knows me too well 😂"*

**Her, 21:34:**
*"Not even hungry tbh. Already full from your place ❤️"*

It made me smile. Made me feel like maybe I'd given her something she could carry with her, even just for a few hours.

The next morning—Christmas Day—she told me she'd dreamt about me.

"Not a good one," she said.

I asked what happened. She didn't elaborate. Just sent a shrug emoji and changed the subject. I didn't push. I never pushed. Pushing only made her pull away.


I saw her again a few days later. December 27th.

She came early, around noon, dressed casually—leggings, an oversized sweater, her hair pulled back into a loose bun. We spent the afternoon together, nothing dramatic. Watched a movie. Talked about nothing important. Had sex—or something approximating it—in the late afternoon light filtering through the curtains. She came. I didn't. The familiar pattern.

Afterward, lying on the bed, she scrolled through her phone while I stared at the ceiling.

"Rate the day," I said, half-joking.

She glanced at me. "Five."

I laughed, even though it stung. "Out of ten?"

"Yup."

"Ouch."

"It's not bad," she said, shrugging. "Just... I don't know. It was fine."

Fine. The death knell of any relationship.

And then she floated away again—to volunteer at some community center, to party with friends, to nap in her own bed. I didn't hear from her until the next day. A single text: *"Miss u."*

---

We synced up again before New Year's.

It was strange, almost eerie, how perfectly we aligned sometimes. We both texted at the exact same time—12:47pm on December 29th. I looked at my phone and saw her message appear as I was typing mine. Same words. Same punctuation.

**Me, 12:47:**
*"Thinking about you"*

**Her, 12:47:**
*"Thinking about you"*

We laughed about it over the phone. Finished each other's sentences. Joked about our one-brain moments. She said, "I don't know what's happening to us."

I didn't know either. But I wanted to believe it meant something.

---

On December 30th, she came over for the last time that year.

We planned a vision board. Talked about 2025. What we wanted. What we hoped for. I asked if she had a printer—she didn't. She improvised with magazine cutouts, scribbled notes on scrap paper, affirmations written in looping cursive. She talked about travel, about her daughters, about finishing her degree. About wanting to feel less stuck.

I didn't ask where I fit into those plans. I was afraid of the answer.

That night, she went to a family hotel dinner. Her dad was visiting from the States. She wore a borrowed dress—something elegant, a little too formal for her usual style—and danced with her dad in the hotel ballroom. She sent me a photo: her smiling, her father's hand on her shoulder, both of them mid-spin under soft golden lights.

She looked happy. Genuinely happy.

And I wondered if maybe she was happier without me.

---

But at midnight on New Year's Eve, while I sat alone on my couch with a glass of whiskey and the faint sound of fireworks popping outside, she messaged me.

**Her, 00:01:**
*"Happy New Year… to my fav person ❤️"*

That should've made me feel secure. Should've felt like a promise. Like an anchor.

But it didn't.

Somewhere beneath the warmth was something unfinished. A countdown I didn't want to acknowledge.

I knew Irish would be back in mid-January. With gifts. And intentions. And dreams of being her one true thing. He'd probably already picked out something thoughtful—jewelry, maybe, or a book she'd mentioned months ago, proof that he listened, that he remembered.

And me? I was thinking about February.

Seventy-three. Another birthday looming on the horizon.

I'd been planning Granada. Maybe snow in the Sierra Nevada. Some sensual adventure. A mirror selfie in lingerie. Something that might remind us both what we were. What we could be.

But even then—even that night, staring at her text message glowing on my phone screen—I wasn't sure if she'd be with me.

We were a family of two.

But only for eight hours.

And not at New Year.

---

I typed back slowly, deliberately.

**Me, 00:04:**
*"Happy New Year to you too. My favorite person ❤️"*

I meant it. Even though I knew it wasn't enough.

Even though I knew we were running out of time.
