# Chapter 5: First Breaches in the Ice Dam

## Valentine's Day Lunch
Lisbon. February 2024.

The lunch was beautiful, but something had shifted.

It was Valentine's Day, and we sat outside at a hotel restaurant near her new HR job. The job that would soon become complicated because the owner really wanted her. He was already fucking her friend at work, but it was Julia he truly desired. At first, he was subtle—telling the friend how beautiful and intelligent he thought Julia was. He even tried to convince the friend to arrange a threesome. But Julia resisted. Eventually, he would start asking her to stay late to work on vague projects, just to spend time with her away from the prying eyes of colleagues.

But that was all still to come.

The midday February Lisbon light was soft, the wine crisp, and she looked flawless—businesslike in pants and a jumper that tried to hide the Double Ds… but couldn't. She was radiant, close, smiling, affectionate. But there was a lightness to her that wasn't rooted in me anymore. A kind of growing independence I hadn't seen before. She was magnetic. She was watchful. She was gently untethered.

{I don't think she meant to be. And I wasn't angry. But something in my gut whispered: I was no longer the center. I was now an echo.}

I had been in Lisbon all week, staying with my ex. It was her birthday—the 13th, a day before Valentine's. We'd gone out for dinner, a familiar ritual laced with unspoken disapproval. She didn't know about Julia. But she knew about the other women. Young Black women. There was judgment in her eyes, restrained behind polite conversation. A civilized dinner hiding the dissonance of who I was becoming.

But Julia—Julia was the truth I needed that week. So I messaged her. Lunch wasn't enough. I needed more than conversation. I needed skin. I needed scent. I needed to mark her… to mark the territory I was losing to the circling tigers.

So we agreed to meet again on Friday night.


## Flashback: December – Benoît

[FLASHBACK: December 2023]

Julia was already texting Benoît—the first Frenchman—before we returned. He had been flirting, slowly turning up the heat. But something in her shifted after Budapest. She began to respond. The barriers came down. The shy, innocent girl was gone.

She told him she was drunk and horny. He invited her to his Christmas party. She agreed.

He wore some ridiculous festive outfit. She wore something short and teasing. They drank. They danced. And then, when the others started leaving, sometime after midnight, the dam broke.

They fucked. Hard. For hours. She told me he was maybe eight inches. Not huge. But enough. She came. Not a squirt—that was still mine—but she came hard.

She stayed the night. They probably fucked in the morning again and showered together. And from then until she left for Angola before Christmas, she fucked him regularly. Several times a week. He wanted her. He kept texting. Even while she was with her family.

But when she returned to Lisbon in January, he ghosted her. No explanation. No closure. Just absence. Maybe another girl. Maybe another toy.

She was hurt. And that hurt reopened something else.


## Seeking.com and the Cars

[FLASHBACK: Seeking.com]

She reactivated her Seeking account—the one we had set up together, ironically, on that strange Sunday in Budapest. She said she felt like I had pushed her into other men's arms. Maybe she was right.

The first man was mid-40s. Portuguese. Always arrived in a different luxury car. Took her out for dinner, then tried to fuck her in the car. Once, she let him try. They kissed, he played with the DDs, she played back, and he surprised her by coming in her hand before anything really happened. Another disappointment. Another wimpy dick story she would later relate. Another man-boy who couldn't handle the goddess.

Then, Tantric.

They matched while I was in Lisbon… but she never told me.


## Friday Night: The Sacred Squirt

We had met that Friday night—the final act. The sacred squirt. She came to the Airbnb after work. We kissed like old lovers. Familiar, warm. The sex was emotional. I kissed her nipples and unlocked her.

She rode me, then I dogged her. Then we moved to the kitchenette's sink. She held on while we entered our standing doggy routine. She groaned as I entered her. She was very wet as we fucked cervix-deep and played our usual games as she started to tense, trying to resist the coming tsunami. But it was always the same—two little squirts as she tried to control it. And then the tsunami when she surrendered to the inevitable.

{It felt like reclaiming something. I'd re-marked my territory. But I knew it wouldn't last for long, because the current beneath her skin had changed.}


## Tantric – Part One: The Massage Table

[FLASHBACK: Tantric – Part One]

The week after I left, she began texting Tantric.

By the time Saturday hit and I was back in Cyprus, they were arranging coffee. He told her he was into massage. Yoni massage. Tantric energy. She had told me massage porn was her go-to when she needed to masturbate. He must have known exactly what to say and do.

She gave herself very easily. And very completely. She surrendered without hesitation. Completely.

He had a beautiful apartment in Lisbon with a rooftop terrace. One room was fully equipped with sex toys, whips, feathers, a massage table, and a special doggy sex stool.

He told her to take off her clothes and lie on the massage table. He warmed up the oil and massaged her whole body, teasing her nipples, her belly, her thighs. Then he began the yoni massage—first gentle, then deeper—sliding inside her and bringing her to a full-body orgasm.

Then he demanded more. She tried to ride him. He refused. Forced her to worship his dick. Then he bent her over the doggy stool, tied her up, and took her from behind. Afterwards, he let her sleep on the rug.

She suspected cameras. Hidden photos. Silent violations.

He sent hypnotic audios after that. Commanding. Creepy.

They met once more.


## Cameroon: The Collapse

[FLASHBACK: Cameroon and the Collapse]

She had been talking to him for months. They laughed. Flirted. Imagined something serious. So when he sent money for her to fly to Asturias, she didn't hesitate.

She went with hope. For love. For roots. For something real.

The vibe was romantic from the start. They held hands. Made plans. Fucked with the rhythm of two people trying to prove something. She said the sex was everything—passionate, comforting, primal. He didn't disappoint.

But underneath the pleasure, the cracks grew.

He told her she wasn't like African women were supposed to be. That she should wake up early. Be submissive. Be obedient. She said nothing, but the truth began to set in: they would never work.

They both cried when he left her at the airport.

A week passed with no contact. The silence confirmed it. And when they finally spoke, it broke. He said she liked fancy places. Her tastes were too European. Too elegant. Too free.

She cried. And then she called Tantric.

{Because Cameroon had broken something emotional. And Tantric was the only one who knew how to break her body.}


## Tantric – Part Two: The Violation

[FLASHBACK: Tantric – Part Two]

There was no massage this time. No sweet talk.

He had already marked her as his submissive. Now he wanted more. To share her. He told her his fantasy was to bring in another man. A friend. For both of them to fuck her. Possibly even double penetration.

To prepare her for that, he demanded anal.

She refused.

But after sex, when she fell asleep beside him, she woke up to find him trying to insert a butt plug in her ass. Without consent. A violation.

He also asked her to accompany him to one of the underground sex parties he frequented—those spaces of exhibitionism, bondage, and public submission.

That was the final red line.

{Something broke in her. The submissive spell cracked.}

She left that session not just shaken—but determined. Determined to reclaim her own power. Not to be just used, filmed, tied, or trained. Not anymore.

She wasn't just prey now. She was becoming something else.

A hunter.

A force.

A tigress who could ride and rule, take and give, tease and command.


## The Category 5 Storm

[FLASHFORWARD: The Category 5 Storm]

In the months that followed, the hurricane hit.

The Greek. The Italian. The Spaniard. The American.

Each one, a new taste. A new fuck.

A fresh wave of proof that she was wanted. Worshipped. Insatiable.

She wanted them. She needed them. She encouraged them. She dared them.

Then she rode them — and made them ride her.

She left them with images they'd never escape.

The taste of her. The sound of her. The look in her eyes when she came.

Some she may have broken.

Just like me, on her next visit to Cyprus.

{Because sometimes, she truly was… insatiable.}

And whatever else she did — she left them enslaved.

Still texting. Still begging. Still remembering.

Even now.

Because she was the erotic hurricane.

And in the middle of it all was me.

Still loving her. Still hoping.

Still remembering that Friday night in Lisbon.

The first breach in the ice dam —

before it burst,

unleashing a tsunami of erotic power…

from the tigress in full heat.
