# Chapter 9: Queen of Ayia Napa

## Day 1: Arrival and Awakening

Julia landed in Larnaca early on Wednesday, September 4th, 2024, and the air already pulsed with the promise of heat, salt, and sin. Her girlfriend was waiting for her at the arrivals lounge, all smiles and wheeled suitcases, and together they boarded the coastal bus to Ayia Napa. The ride took just under an hour, winding along the southeastern edge of Cyprus through dusty roads and glimpses of turquoise beyond the cliffs.
By the time they checked into their hotel, it was mid-morning. The room was basic but clean — a double bed, a small balcony overlooking a tired pool, and just enough space to explode their suitcases into outfits, heels, and swimsuits. No time for sleep. They were in Ayia Napa. {This was the week they had promised themselves — no boyfriends, no rules, just sun, skin, and sensation. The narrator marks this as the threshold moment—the beginning of the addiction spiral.}
By noon they were dressed and glowing. Julia wore black linen pants and a bikini top that made her skin pop like caramel against silk. Her hair was loose. Her perfume — sweet, tropical, and lightly spiced — left a wake in the corridor. They waited outside the hotel for a taxi to Nikki Beach, one of the hottest daytime scenes in Ayia Napa.
That's when they met him.
He was already standing there — tall, white, early 30s. Clean-cut but casual, backpack slung over one shoulder, hotel keycard in the other. {He turned, looked at Julia once — and never stopped. The narrator emphasizes the moment of connection, the spark of dopamine that will fuel the week.}
"You heading to Nikki?" he asked, not even pretending to speak to her friend.
"We are," her friend answered, flicking her braids. "You?"
He smiled. "Thought I recognized you two from the airport. Want to share a ride?"
They nodded. The van was a big, white people mover — music already playing softly from the radio. They sat apart at first, Julia and her friend on the middle row, Zürich behind them. He introduced himself — Swiss, from Zürich, on holiday alone, bored already. His eyes rarely left Julia's profile. She didn't give him much — just a sly smile, a tilted chin, a quick glance back through her lashes — but it was enough. She had this aura now. The kind that didn't have to flirt. The kind that simply was.
At Nikki Beach, the party was already on. Palm trees lined the edge of the venue. Lounge beds, white cushions, barefoot DJs. Models and muscle. But when Julia walked in, everything paused — at least in her own mind. This wasn't fantasy. This wasn't a dream. She was being seen. Properly. From the moment they stepped out of the van, bouncers ushered them through without asking for tickets. The host handed them free drink cards without blinking. A server offered shots "from the house." Men turned. Girls stared. Julia felt it flood her.
She was a 10+. Maybe for the first time, she truly knew it.
Zürich hovered close, not clingy — but always in orbit. He bought them drinks. Sat nearby. Tried to enter the circle without forcing it. When music surged, Julia danced. Loose, fluid, magnetic. Her sunglasses down, her hips soft and sensual, her laughter bubbling over. It didn't matter who she was dancing for. She was dancing as herself — free, adored, alive.
Later that afternoon, as the sun began its descent, the bar was buzzing. Julia was dancing — slow, sensual, magnetic — her hips moving to the rhythm as guys hovered around, drawn in like moths to flame. But it was Zürich who stayed closest. He didn't dominate, but he was there — orbiting her, responding to her glances, daring little touches when the music rose. A brush of her lower back. A hand that lingered a moment too long on her hip. She let him. Played with him. Laughed at something he said, then turned, pressed her body softly into his — and kissed him. Deep. Hungry. Unapologetic. Right there at the bar. Eyes watching. Music crashing. Tongues tasting.
There was nothing light about it.
When she pulled back, he looked stunned — dazed even — and grinned like a schoolboy. It wasn't just the kiss. It was that she had chosen to give it.

## The Taxi Home: What's Going On Back There?

Later, they piled into the big white people mover again — the same van from earlier. Her girlfriend climbed into the front seat, leaving Julia and Zürich alone in the very back row. Hidden. Shadowed. The music was loud, and everyone was drunk, laughing, talking over each other.
But in the back?
Pure electricity.
Julia leaned into him, lips brushing his neck. He groaned softly. Her hand slid onto his thigh — then further. He was already hard. She giggled, fingers teasing him through his shorts, then slipping under the waistband. He gasped.
His hand found her breast. Then under her dress. No panties. Just wet, warm skin. He traced her lips, then slipped a finger in. She bit her lip and moaned into his neck.
They were laughing now — softly, drunkenly, kissing hard, devouring each other in the dark. His hand between her legs, hers wrapped around his cock. Movements hidden by shadows and rumbling wheels.
Suddenly the driver barked:
"What's going on back there?!"
Everyone laughed — but the tone in his voice wasn't amused. It was jealous. Burning with envy. He couldn't see, but he knew.
Julia just smiled, wiped her mouth, and kissed Zürich again — slower this time.
And then they were back at the hotel. They all got out and Julia and her friend went back to their room and Zurich went back to his… trying to hide his erection.
That night, back at the hotel, Julia showered slowly, thoughtfully. She was buzzing. She felt like herself and someone else all at once. She and her girlfriend changed again — this time for clubbing. A short sequined skirt, a black halter, glowing skin and lip gloss. And out they went.
The clubs were chaos. Packed with tourists and predators, flashing lights and pulsing beats. And yet again — Julia was the center. The VIP bouncers waved her through. Barmen handed her free shots. Girls came up to dance with her, laugh with her. And that's where she met them — the girls who would shape the rest of the week:
* The Paris Virgin — a sweet, awkward Black girl in her mid-20s, never kissed, clinging to her rum and Coke like a lifeline.

* The London Nympho — pierced, tatted, in fishnets and a mesh bodysuit, already grinding on a stranger.

* The Lover's Girl — graceful, friendly, spending the night texting the guy who claimed to love her from first sight.

* The Turkish Sisters from Germany — elegant, generous, already watching Julia from across the room, drawn to her power and glow.

The night turned into morning. Julia and her friend returned to the hotel just before sunrise — heels in hand, hair wild, laughter still leaking from their lips. She lay on the bed wide awake, scrolling through WhatsApps from Zürich, smiling at his awkward charm, not yet seeing the storm coming.
For now, she was weightless.

## Day Two: The Beach and the Invitation

The next morning, Julia woke late but smiling. Her girlfriend was already up, dancing around the hotel room in a towel, humming some Afrobeat tune and rubbing lotion into her calves.
"Sleep well, princesa?" she teased.
Julia stretched and yawned. Her body ached in the best possible way. Not from sex — yet — but from the wildness of the night before. The dancing, the attention, the slow burn in the back of the van with Zürich. He hadn't messaged yet.
But that didn't last long.
By the time they got to the beach — a stunning, open stretch of white sand dotted with umbrellas and wandering cocktails in plastic cups — he was already texting.
Zurich:
 "Still thinking about yesterday and the taxi home. Can't stop smiling. Can I see you later?"
Julia read it and smirked. Her girlfriend peeked over.
"That your taxi lover?"
Julia nodded. "Persistent."
"You going to fuck him?"
Julia just laughed.
They found the others near the shoreline: the shy French girl from Paris, still in her oversized T-shirt and sun hat, eyes big and gentle like a baby deer. Julia had taken a liking to her immediately. There was something soft and untouched about her — maybe what Julia had once been.
Then there was the nympho from London, already stretched out topless on her towel, flirting with some waiter who wasn't even serving their section.
"She's insane," Julia whispered. "But kinda iconic."
The sun blazed. The water shimmered. The drinks kept coming, somehow always free — cocktails, slushies, little shots brought over by smirking bartenders who kept asking for her number. Julia felt untouchable. Magnetic. Worshipped.
Zürich kept messaging — never creepy, but needy.
By mid-afternoon, her friend flopped back on the towel. "I'm gonna crash early tonight, babe. Too much heat, too many shots."
Julia looked down at her screen.
Dinner then? Just you and me? I'll pick a place.
 Zürich.
She replied:
Okay. Don't make it boring.

## Day Two: Dinner and the Hotel

He picked a small rooftop restaurant near the edge of town — not too fancy, not too cheap — where candles flickered in low glass jars and the sea shimmered below them in the dusk.
Julia arrived alone, a few minutes late, wearing a short satin dress in forest green. Her legs glowed bronze in the last light. Zürich stood when he saw her, but couldn't speak for a moment. His breath caught. She noticed.
"Good choice," she said, brushing past him toward the table. "Now let's see if your conversation matches the view."
Zürich smiled, nervous. But he loosened up with the wine. They laughed. Talked about travel, music, exes, broken hearts. He confessed he'd been with too many women too quickly after a bad breakup. Said he'd been jacking off too much lately. That sometimes, with new women, his dick didn't work.
Julia raised an eyebrow. "You tell all your dates that?"
He laughed, embarrassed. "Just setting expectations."
She took a sip of wine. "Then I hope you'll pleasantly surprise me."
The tension between them tightened like a silk cord. His eyes kept drifting to her neckline, to her thighs. She let him look.
After dessert, he paid. She didn't argue. As they left, he hovered beside her, unsure.
"My place is closer," he said. "No pressure."
She turned to him, deadpan. "If your dick doesn't work, I'll be home in twenty minutes."

Back at his hotel room, things moved fast. She kicked off her shoes by the door. He offered her a drink — she shook her head. Just looked at him. Daring.
He stepped closer.
They kissed. This time, no audience, no hesitation.
His hands found her hips. Her dress slid up easily. She pushed him back onto the bed, straddled him, slowly grinding, testing. He was already hard.
"Hmm," she whispered, "seems like you're full of surprises."
She guided him inside her — no teasing now — and rode him hard. She came once, then again, biting her lip to stay quiet. He flipped her, fucked her deep. She scratched his back, moaned into his neck.
By the end, they were both soaked in sweat, breathless.
He lay there stunned.
She got up, walked naked to the bathroom, and called back:
"Guess your expectations were wrong."

## Day Three Morning: One Last Time

She woke to his hand between her thighs. Hard again. They fucked slowly this time, faces close, eyes locked. He kissed her breast as she came a third time. Then again. She rolled onto her stomach, smiling into the pillow.
At 10:00 sharp, she dressed, freshened up, and kissed him once — light, almost formal.
"No texting every hour," she warned. "I have a whole day ahead of me."
And she was gone.

## Day Three: The Queen Awakens

Julia slid the keycard into the hotel room door just after 10 a.m., still damp from her second shower of the morning. Her skin tingled. Not from soap or heat — from memory. From Zürich's hands. From the way he'd pinned her, surprised himself, surprised her. Twice last night. Once more this morning. And yet here she was, poker-faced, already rehearsing the story she'd tell.
Her girlfriend was still in bed, scrolling idly through Instagram.
"You sleep okay?" she asked, eyes not leaving the screen.
"Yeah," Julia said, toweling her hair like it was nothing. "Just walked. Couldn't sleep. Watched the sunrise."
A pause. A glance. Nothing more.
They went to the beach.
It was hot, and the sand burned their feet, but the water was a silk ribbon of blue. Julia stretched out on her towel like a cat. Her sunglasses were oversized, her bikini neon pink, her presence impossible to ignore. Men stared as they passed. Some circled back. One offered to buy her a drink without even asking her name.
And then she saw him.
Zürich.
Not close — not directly — but close enough. Alone. Shirt off. Lying on a lounger like a forgotten souvenir. He looked over once. Then again. Then his phone lit up.
"Why are you ignoring me?"
She didn't respond.
"Are you ashamed to be seen with me?"
She let it buzz.
"Was last night just a game to you?"
She turned her phone screen-down.
She was busy.
Busy watching the world orbit her.
Busy soaking in this new sensation: that she didn't need to chase affection. That she drew it. Pulled it in like gravity. She didn't even have to try.
Her friend, on the other hand, had grown quiet. Cold. She snapped at a harmless comment Julia made about the sea. When Julia tried to offer her a drink, she refused. Then later — as they walked back toward the hotel — she turned suddenly.
"You know what?" she said. "I think I'm gonna leave tomorrow. My mom wants me in Limassol."
Julia blinked. "Are you serious?"
"Yeah. I mean… it's not really fun here anymore. Not for me."
The words stung more than they should have. Julia didn't reply. She just kept walking.
That night, they dressed up — the last time they would go out together.
Julia wore the tiny green skirt that clung to her hips and a black crop top that tied in the middle. Her heels made her legs look even longer. Her friend barely spoke as they met up with the girls from Trip BFF.
There was the elegant Paris girl — shy, soft, eyes full of questions and wonder. Julia felt strangely protective of her, like looking into a mirror of her past.
Then the London nympho — pierced, brash, constantly grinding on men like it was oxygen. By midnight, she was already tongue-deep with some bouncer by the bathroom.
Another girl had been claimed by a local who swore he was in love — his arms always around her, whispering promises in broken English.
The clubs were madness. Bass like thunder. Bodies everywhere. And Julia?
Julia owned it.
Every man looked at her. Bartenders gave her drink cards before she asked. Promoters pulled her into VIP. A DJ blew her a kiss mid-set. She laughed, danced, let the music flood her.
Her phone buzzed in her hand.
Zürich.
Again.
"I miss you."
 "Please talk to me."
 "I can't stop thinking about last night."
 "You're everywhere and nowhere."
She didn't reply.
Because she was everywhere. And she belonged to no one.
That night — or maybe morning — at 7 a.m., she slipped her heels off and padded barefoot back to the hotel. The streets were pink with sunrise. Her friend was already asleep. Or pretending.
Julia slid under the sheets, alone. Legs sore. Heart racing.
Something had shifted. Not just in the clubs.
In her.
"I don't need to chase love," she whispered into the pillow.
"I only need to show up — and love chases me."

## Day Four: The Queen Alone

She came home at sunrise.
Her heels in hand, eyeliner smudged, the zipper on her dress halfway down. She closed the hotel room door quietly, trying not to wake her friend — but it was too late. The light was already on. Her friend sat on the edge of the bed, suitcase half-packed.
"My mom needs help at the shop," she said, without looking up. "I have to go back to Limassol."
Julia blinked. "Today?"
A shrug. "She asked."
But the air was heavy with something else. Her friend wouldn't meet her eyes. Wouldn't ask how the night was. Wouldn't laugh or tease or offer gossip.
Julia knew the truth. She was too much. Too magnetic. Too seen. And the jealousy — quiet but sharp — had crept into their friendship like smoke through a closed window.
By noon, her friend was gone.
Julia lay back on the hotel bed, alone. For the first time in Ayia Napa, alone. And the silence felt heavier than she expected.

Afternoon. The Beach.
She needed air. And attention.
By 3pm, she was on the sand — a white crochet bikini, golden anklet, and her sunglasses that made her feel like a celebrity dodging paparazzi.
She wasn't alone for long.
A pair of Turkish-German sisters — mid-20s, stylish, confident — came over as she was sipping her iced coffee at a nearby kiosk.
"We saw you last night," the taller one said, her nails blood-red. "You were… stunning."
Julia smiled. "Thanks."
"You shouldn't be alone," said the other, who had hazel eyes and a low-cut dress that screamed Berlin nightlife. "Let's hang. We're going out again tonight. You coming?"
Julia nodded, genuinely grateful. She didn't say it out loud, but she felt it: Thank God. I need girls tonight. I can't handle another Zurich.

Evening. Clubs. And Chaos.
She stayed in until midnight, moving slowly — long bath, her gold body shimmer oil. Then she slipped into a dress that clung like a second skin, heels that could stop traffic, and a mood that screamed: I belong here.
They met at the same club from the night before. Turkish girls. Paris girl. Even the nympho made a brief appearance before disappearing with a tattooed guy in mesh pants.
It didn't take long for Zürich to show up.
He must have been watching her stories. Or following her location. Or just circling the clubs like a predator.
This time, he was drunk. Sloppy. Angry.
"She's my girlfriend," he barked at one guy who leaned in to talk to her.
Julia rolled her eyes. "No, I'm not."
He tried to hold her hand. She yanked it away.
Then — chaos.
One guy bumped him accidentally while trying to squeeze past the bar. Zürich shoved him. Voices were raised. Hands went up. Security stepped in.
Julia didn't wait to see how it ended.
"Let's go," she said to the girls.
And they left. Just like that. Back out into the warm Cypriot night, music fading behind them, laughter rising ahead.

Another Club. A New Throne.
They hit a new spot. One Julia hadn't seen before. Different music, different crowd. But the same result.
Every man turned to stare.
She ordered her drinks with a smirk and got them for free — again. She danced in a circle of women, hair whipping, sweat glistening. Her hips became gravity. Her smile, a spell.
Zürich wasn't there.
And it felt good.

Sunrise. Again.
She walked home just before seven, barefoot again, fries in one hand, shoes in the other. She hadn't fucked anyone — but she didn't need to.
She had been desired by everyone.
And that was enough.
But something deeper flickered in her chest now. Not pride. Not power.
Just the echo of being alone.
And what it meant to be seen by all — and known by none.

## Sunday: The Sea Caves and the Screams

Julia woke with a groan and a stretch. Her body ached, but in that delicious way that reminded her she'd danced until dawn. She'd walked out on Zürich last night — walked right out of the club with the Turkish girls, leaving him glaring, fists clenched, shouting nonsense. It should have felt dramatic. It didn't. It felt necessary.
The sun was high already. Tourist day.
By noon, she and a few of the girls were on a boat gliding toward the sea caves — white limestone cliffs shimmering against impossibly turquoise waters. Sunlight danced across her bare shoulders. Julia wore only a black bikini and oversized sunglasses, her hair tied in a simple bun, no makeup at all. The others had gone full influencer mode — false lashes, contour, bright lipstick. Julia didn't need it. The boat crew couldn't take their eyes off her.
They weren't alone. A group of guys — Portuguese maybe, or Lebanese — were lounging near the bow. They offered to take photos of the girls, but mostly just wanted shots with Julia. One guy touched her elbow a little too long when handing her phone back. Another complimented her skin, her smile, her energy. She posed playfully. She smiled for the camera. She knew.
One of them whispered, "You should be a model."
Another, bolder: "You already are."
Her phone buzzed, again and again.
Zürich.
"You should've taken me with you."
"I could've shown you secret places."
"Why are you ghosting me?"
"I didn't mean what I said. I was drunk and jealous and stupid."
She didn't reply.
That evening, they met up again — the Trip BFF crew. The Turkish sisters. The Paris girl. Even the wild Nympho, though she disappeared after a single drink, off to fuck her third conquest of the weekend. Julia danced with the girls, flirted with a bartender, laughed with tourists who spoke broken English and had eyes full of lust. One girl kissed her on the dance floor — soft, curious — and Julia didn't pull away. For a few moments, they just moved, lips and hips, in rhythm. Some men cheered. One took a photo.
She wasn't even drunk. Just alive.
At 2:07am, her phone buzzed again.
"Come to my hotel."
She stared at the message.
And then she went.

Zürich opened the door in boxer shorts and nervous energy. His eyes wide, hopeful. His room was neat, too neat — like he'd been waiting for hours.
"I wasn't sure you'd come," he said.
"I wasn't sure either," she replied.
They sat on the bed. Talked. Laughed. He kept apologizing.
"You're not like the others," he said. "You're in my head. All the time."
He kissed her. She let him.
Soon, his hands were on her thighs. Her dress slipped up. He kissed her breasts. She pulled his boxers down. He was hard.
"You see?" he whispered. "You fixed me."
They fell into bed — tangled, naked, hungry. Her legs wrapped around him. His fingers explored her like a map he'd already memorized. She moaned. He growled.
And then — snap.
The mood cracked.
He pulled back, stared at her.
"You're so fucking perfect," he said.
She smiled, eyes half-lidded. "Then fuck me."
But his face shifted. Eyes darkened.
"You flirt with everyone," he said, voice tightening.
She blinked.
"You were dancing with that guy. That French guy."
"What?"
"And kissing girls. Do you think I'm stupid?"
"Zürich—"
"No. No. You're embarrassed to be with me, aren't you? You show off to everyone. You love the attention."
She sat up, pulled the sheet around her. "I'm going."
He stood, naked, angry. "You're a whore! A fucking whore!"
She dressed quickly, ignoring him. Grabbed her bag.
He followed her into the hallway, still shouting.
"SLUT! EVERY GUY IN TOWN WANTS TO FUCK YOU AND YOU LOVE IT!"
She didn't turn around. Just kept walking.
A night manager looked up from the desk as she entered the lobby.
"Is everything alright, miss?"
Zürich was still behind her, face red, veins bulging.
The concierge stepped forward. "If you don't leave her alone right now, I'm calling the police."
Zürich stopped.
Julia didn't. She walked straight out the front door into the silent, humid night.
And never looked back.

## Monday: The Divine

She woke late — sunlight filtering through gauzy curtains, her body sore in all the right ways, but her soul… strangely calm.
Yesterday's chaos with Zürich already felt distant. The rage, the hotel corridor, the concierge's warning — it had all burned away overnight like bad alcohol, leaving behind only clarity. Something had snapped, but not inside her. Something had snapped off — a tether, a weight. And she didn't miss it.
Down at Nikki Beach, the girls had already claimed a prime spot. The Turkish sisters waved her over, grinning. They'd brought juice, fruit, sunglasses that didn't match their outfits. Julia kissed both their cheeks and dropped her towel. Even in just a bikini, she drew eyes — not because she tried, but because she didn't.
Men came and went. One offered to rub lotion on her back. Another brought over iced coffees "for the ladies." One tried to start a photo conversation: "Are you an influencer? You look like one."
She didn't flirt. She didn't even try. Still, they came.
"You're too perfect," one finally said. "You scare me a little."
She smiled at that. Not sweetly. Not to please him. Just… knowingly.
She danced at the beach bar when the DJ turned up the tempo. Barefoot, eyes closed, hips swaying in the hot afternoon air. Her girlfriends clapped and joined. Others hovered. She didn't care. She was in it.
By nightfall, she barely needed to get ready. A splash of cheek color, a touch of gloss. No lashes, no heavy contour. Her skin glowed naturally. The other girls — faces painted like porcelain masks — stared.
They hit the clubs around midnight. Same as always, but not the same.
The bouncer greeted her with a wink. The bartender poured her a drink before she even ordered. A group of guys turned as she walked in — one bumped into his own friend because he wasn't watching where he was going.
Inside, the music took her.
She was the Dancing Queen now. Center of the floor, untamed, radiant. Her girlfriends orbited like moons. Guys circled, drifted closer, hovered — some bold, some terrified.
One tried to join her dance. She let him for a moment, then spun away. Another reached out to touch her waist — the Turkish sisters stepped in.
And then it happened.
From across the room, she approached. A girl — tall, striking, wild-eyed. Black crop top, tattoos on her ribs, honey-toned skin. They met on the beat. No words. Just heat.
They danced. Closer. Hips brushing. Breaths mingling. Then lips — soft, tentative, teasing. The crowd slowed. Eyes locked on them. Some men cheered. Others just stared.
Julia kissed her again — deeper this time. Not for them. For her.
And then she was gone. The girl disappeared into the crowd. The moment passed. But not its effect.
Julia danced for another hour, maybe two. The club was hers. The night was hers. She was kissed, complimented, offered drinks, phone numbers, hotel keys.
She didn't take any of them.
At 5:30 a.m., she walked home alone, heels in hand, heart steady, head clear.
The Queen didn't need a king.
Not tonight.

## Tuesday: Her Last Night in Ayia Napa

She woke up slower than usual. Not hungover exactly — that was too crude a word for it. But something had shifted.
Her throat felt raw. Her skin dry. Her limbs heavy, like she was swimming through invisible syrup. The nights were catching up: the cocktails, the secondhand smoke, the sweat-drenched clubs, the laughter that turned into screams on the dancefloor. All of it.
She was still radiant. But under the surface, something was fraying.
Still, this was her last night. She wasn't about to let it slip away quietly.
Her girlfriends rallied, coaxing her out of bed with jokes and coffee and stories from the night before. There were whispers about one of the Turkish sisters fucking a guy behind a beach shack. Another had kissed a bartender after too many shots. The Nympho hadn't been seen since 4 a.m.
Julia just smiled. Listened. Recharged.
By nightfall, she dressed slower. Less glitter, more grace. Her hair loose. A light shimmer on her cheekbones. She chose a soft red lip instead of the usual gloss.
She wasn't dressing to kill tonight.
She was dressing to feel.

At the club, the barman saw her immediately. He was tall, tanned, with kind eyes and a confident calm that cut through the noise. He'd served her before. Watched her. Admired her. But tonight, he moved closer.
Made her a cocktail without her ordering.
Smiled as he slid it across the bar.
Touched her hand just long enough to say, I see you.
She liked him.
But the night was slippery. People pulled at her from every side — girls, guys, DJs, strangers asking for selfies, tourists trying to dance with her. The Queen still had her court. But her body was saying something else.
She danced, yes. She always danced.
But it was different now — slower, more fluid, more internal.
She wasn't chasing joy. She was preserving it.

Later, standing by the rail outside the club, her phone buzzed.
It was you.
Or maybe it was her texting first — doesn't matter. What matters is the message she finally typed out:
"Hey… I think I'm getting sick. Can you help me change my flight?"
A pause.
Then a second message:
"Not sure I can do another night like this."
Her fingers trembled slightly as she pressed send. Not from fear.
From the quiet realization that the fantasy was dissolving.
She walked home alone that night.
Not because she couldn't have had company.
But because she was enough. And for now, that would have to do.

## Wednesday: The Departure

She woke up with the sun burning behind her eyes and the ache of too many nights echoing in her chest.
The Queen didn't feel royal today.
She felt drained, tender-throated, and strangely hollow — like the music had stopped and no one had noticed but her.
Packing was slow. Her glitter heels were scuffed. Her bikinis still smelled of ocean and smoke. Her dresses clung to her like memories.
She left for the airport early, holding a fresh ticket I'd bought the night before — €300 to bring her home a few hours sooner.
It was pointless.
The original flight, the one she'd canceled, ended up leaving at almost the same time. The delay dragged across the day like molasses. Six hours. Seven. More.
Larnaca Airport felt like purgatory: white lights, plastic chairs, overpriced water bottles. She curled up near her gate like a fallen goddess, hoodie over her head, cough creeping in, lips dry.
Bouquet was texting nonstop.
"Are you ok?"
"What time do you land?"
"Want me to pick you up?"
"I miss you…"
But the answers were slow.
She wasn't sure what she needed.
Certainly not flowers right now.

## Thursday: Arrival — The Court Is Gone

The plane touched down just after sunrise.
Lisbon was soft that morning — skies pale grey, air humid. The city didn't care that she'd just lived a thousand nights in seven days. The tarmac offered no red carpet. Just dull steps and a quiet terminal.
No Bouquet. He was working.
No me. My daughter was visiting, and I was pissed off, silent. Distant.
She went through passport control. Picked up her case and called an Uber. Slumped in the back seat. Hoodie up. Phone down. No lipstick. No makeup. No perfume.
The Queen was home.
But the court was gone.
The dancers were gone.
The kingdom of Ayia Napa had disappeared into smoke and sweat and saltwater.
Lisbon didn't know who she was.
And for a moment, neither did she.
She stepped into her father's house. Dropped her bag. Pulled the curtains shut.
Her body was different. Her mind was louder. Her heart was cracked but proud.
Something had ended.
Something else was now beginning.
And she would never be the same again.
