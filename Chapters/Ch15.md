# Chapter 15: Dream Cruise

## Venice Arrival

Venice should have been a love letter. It started like a missed call.

I came in the cheap way, Ryanair from Charleroi to Treviso, bus to Piazzale Roma. She flew into Marco Polo with the big case and her carry-on. Simple plan: she'd ride the Alilaguna boat to San Zaccaria, I'd walk from the bus to the hotel, and we'd meet under the blue timetable signs. Then a slow walk to the hotel. A shower. A kiss. A reset.

Her battery died halfway across the lagoon.

When the boat docked, she refused to wait. Thirty kilos of fashion and future, one hand-bag, no Google Maps, pride on full beam—she started walking. The first bridge tested her. The second unstitched her. By the third she was asking for directions in a language she didn't have.

The men performed sexism—commentary about legs, lips and curves thrown like coins. The tourists performed racism—small sharp comments aimed sideways from behind camera straps. She later told me two Chinese tourists laughed about "African girls who come to find men," then asked for a selfie. A pair of Italians offered to "help" carry the case for a drink later. She kept moving. That meant they kept talking.

Meanwhile I was texting a dead phone. Ten minutes. Twenty. Thirty. The little worry that lives under the ribs started to pace.

At 14:07 a message landed: "I'm here." Two words; no punctuation; everything else unsaid. I ran.

Five flights of stairs. No lift. Venice can be petty when it's winning. I found her in our small hotel room with high ceilings and a mirror that made us look like we were pretending. She was on the bed, soaking up the AC, bra strap peeking, hair pulled into a knot that had lost the argument hours ago. The big case stood there like a boxer who'd gone all twelve rounds. Her face: a beautiful storm rotating around a silent eye.

"I was at San Zaccaria the whole time," I said, stupidly—because what I meant was I should have been the wall between you and the world.

She shrugged it off with the grace of someone who files pain quickly. "It's fine," she said, which in our dictionary meant *It's not.* She went to the sink and splashed her face. I stood behind her in the mirror and watched the lines of fatigue at the corners of her mouth, the way her shoulders squared before anyone asked them to.

We tried the soft reset: shower, fresh shirt, a short lie-down under the fan where the room hummed like a promise. For ten minutes we were two bodies on clean white sheets.

Evening brought food. We chose a small trattoria by a narrow canal where the boats sigh when they pass. Aperol spritz for her, red wine for me. The tourist menu had pictures. I wanted her to laugh. She watched the water and pulled the edge of her sleeve down over her wrist as if she could undo what the day had done. When the waiter said *signora* with that brand of charm that contains appraisal, she smiled with her mouth and nowhere else. We ate well—carbonara done the Roman way, grilled prawns with lemon the way she likes—but the food landed in silence.

After dinner we drifted toward San Marco. A trio did the greatest hits; couples pretended the song was for them. She stood at the edge of it, gorgeous and elsewhere. "I'm tired," she said. Truce.

Back in the room, windows cracked to Venice noise. Phones charging. A calendar tile for the funeral glowed on mine; I turned it face-down. "Tomorrow we board." "Mhm." "We'll make it good." Another "mhm." Then, small and flat: "Men are disgusting." (Not me; the bridge men.)

I held her hand. We slept in pieces. The case stood at the foot of the bed like a dare.


## Embarcation & Kotor

We checked out late, rolled the big case back into the heat, and took the vaporetto to Piazzale Roma. She was quiet, head down, a step apart. Venice had used its teeth.

From Piazzale Roma we grabbed a taxi to the cruise terminal: a queue disguised as a building. Metal barriers, families shedding layers, toddlers on polished concrete. We checked in all our luggage—cruise newbies—not realizing delivery wouldn't happen until much later. Security beeped. A woman in a blazer told Julia how "stunning" she looked. We collected our cruise cards.

A shuttle ferried us to where the ship loomed. We climbed the gangway with that mid-journey feeling of commitment you can't quite escape.

Up to Deck 5. Inside: cold air, piano jazz, queuing. Arrival photo. Then the drinks package hard sell. I bought two like an idiot trying to purchase peace. A crew member pressed a map into my palm. Julia perked for a moment—escalators, atrium, chandelier like frozen champagne—then folded back.

We found the cabin. Key card stuttered, surrendered. I watched tugs ease us from the berth. Muster drill on TV. We trooped out, passes scanned.

We had no bags yet, so we drifted to the Deck 5 bar. Julia began her measured attack on the cocktail list. I had a beer. Dinner at 7:30—dreadful table, dead centre, crying babies. I told her we'd change it.

Back to the Deck 5 bar. Decent live band. Julia wore her short green dress—tits out, every curve hugged. The Brazilian animators buzzed around her, peeled her away to dance. We stayed till 11. No argument. Julia's period had started—no sex. We fell asleep. First day on board: maybe the best evening we had. No breakup. That would be unique.

**Kotor** arrived like a postcard that forgot to be cynical. From our port-side cabin we watched the ship snake into the long bay—green arms, stone knuckles. We bolted for Deck 5, found a giant queue. Eventually funnelled to Deck 4, cruise cards scanned, into another queue.

Hop-on buses were shambolic. We pushed out. A local driver approached—four hours, all the sights, reasonable price. We said yes.

First stop: switchback road to a lookout over the bay. Photos, wind, Julia bought shot glasses. Then to an island. Our driver said walk to the harbour, a boatman would take us across.

We climbed into a small launch with Mexican girls and Brazilian women in sheer pants. Julia sat tight, suddenly wary. Later she told me—she'd caught their Spanish and Portuguese: *Were we really together? How old was I?* The comments needled. By the time we reached the island church, she'd slipped into a shame state—distant, self-contained. I wandered; she orbited alone.

Back up the hill, back to port. She had no interest in the old town. "I'm tired. Let's beat the queues." We boarded.

She chose a long black dress with white beading. Drinks at Deck 5. Then to see the maître d'—he was gracious: come back at 9:30, better table sorted. Julia was on her period—day two—so she ordered a T-bone and demolished it.

After dinner we went to Deck 11 bar. Disco, ABBA, Motown. We danced close, then apart. I spun her; she laughed; one curl came loose. For a minute I believed this trip might pay off the last twelve months.

Around 23:30 they arrived—three Black women. Braids, bright lips, two gloriously voluptuous, one skinny and shy. They walked in with energy the night bends toward. Julia's posture changed instantly. Joy rose in her face.

"Let me go say hi to my sisters," she laughed.

Then she was with them: hugs, laughter, drifting to the center. Drinks, dancing, more dancing—Ayia Napa queen again. Cruise Queen. She loved it. Squeals, hips syncing, homecoming on rhythm and shared Black identity.

I kept smiling. Danced alone, doing the harmless white-dad bit, then caught myself. She was incandescent, a sister among sisters. The room tilted toward them. Pride and emptiness took turns in my chest. I slipped to the bar, beer sweating, watched—shocked at how free she was when I wasn't her audience.

By 00:30, the patient part of me clocked off. I felt abandoned—dropped the instant her sisters appeared. Worse: I could see the joy I rarely author, the freedom she never shows me. This was Queen Julia. And I was the man she could put down like a stone.

I edged to her circle. "I'm heading back. Stay out. Stay till four if you want." Permission, and a test.

"I'll come soon," she said—sweat-bright, happy in a way I almost never author. The song took her again.

Ship corridors at night are honest: carpet, light, low machinery of forward motion. In the cabin I sat and let the air-con make its weather. Sunscreen and her hair in the air. The funeral date in my calendar like a bruise I kept pressing. Love, pride, jealousy, shame, guilt—the whole cocktail—topped up by the bar upstairs.

The later it got, the more the anger rose. I reached for my phone and wrote, verbatim:

*For me it's over. I have been fooling myself for too long now. We are embarrassing together. I must stop it and I WILL. I don't expect her until at least 3 o'clock and there'll be lots of excuses about having fun with her sisters. But for me, it is now over finally and forever. And I really don't want any more contact with her even though the rest of this vacation will be a disaster. On Thursday it's my mother's funeral, which I'll miss because of this shit. 😱😱😱😱 I hereby swear that we are FINISHED and she gets NO more MONEY from ME 👎👎*

At 02:00, with only the ship for company, I turned off the light and rehearsed what I'd say in the morning. She came in quietly, trying not to wake me. I pretended sleep.

The cruise to hell had started.


## At Sea & Silent Disco Conflict

Morning came cool and almost kind. The ship slid through blank water. I wrote an apology I meant, then fought the ransom-priced Wi-Fi:

*I'm really sorry about last night and would like to explain. This trip has unlocked some really powerful emotions—love, jealousy, pride, shame, guilt. None helped by all the booze. Last night was going so well and then your sisters arrived and I felt abandoned. Then I saw the joy you had with them—joy you never show with me. I tried to let you have fun. Then jealousy kicked in… and betrayal… and guilt for missing my mother's funeral. That guilt isn't your fault because I never told you. I'm sad for how it ended. Please tell me how you want to finish the voyage.*

She replied she wanted to continue as best we could.

So we kept the morning careful. Deck 11 buffet for her with the sisters; she texted me to join. We were both awkward. I finished quickly and whispered, "I'll give you space. See you later."

Sun-deck shuffle. Every lounger "reserved" by a towel. I parked near the pool, tanned, dipped. Skipped lunch. Back to the room for a nap. No Julia. Later I drifted to Deck 11, passed the Zumba class, hid in a bar with Wimbledon on TV. Tried cocktails—oppressively sweet.

By evening the day had worn us down to workable. She'd meet me at dinner—9:30—after seeing the girls. Around 9:15 I found Julia and the sisters taking selfies like it was a job.

She wore another of her designs: corset top, cleavage high, waist snatched, short hem, high heels. Inside, our Filipino waiter remembered everything. We talked logistics—Mykonos tomorrow. Ordinary felt like oxygen.

After dinner: "quick drink with the girls," then she'd meet me at the silent disco, Deck 12 club at 11:30.

I killed time at Deck 11. Near midnight I went up. Headphones, three channels—disco, Afrobeats. I took disco; the sisters took Afrobeats. Three tribes passing through each other like weather systems.

I found Julia with the sisters—and Luca, the Italian sleeping with one of them. The other Jane came over and we danced. I turned, and we laughed our way into a cheeky bum-to-bum routine. Twenty minutes. Innocent to me; not to Julia.

Later she'd say the kids were pointing, couples scandalized—she was embarrassed. I went to the bar for drinks. Didn't improve her mood. Around 1:00 I told her to enjoy the night.

Back in the cabin, I listened to the air-con. Sometime after two the handle turned. She came in quietly. Cold. Something wrong.

"Your bum-bouncing was far too sensual," she said. "You embarrassed me."

Words tripped. She said I was performing for other women. I said I was being civil. "You're a fucking hypocrite. When I don't engage with your friends, I'm wrong. When I do, I'm still wrong."

She walked. Lights out.

Around 4:00 she climbed on top, pressed her breasts into my face, told me she loved me. Still on her period—no sex. She reached for the lipstick vibrator; I took her nipples in my mouth. She came fast, hard, then dropped into deep sleep.

Mine didn't. *What do I have to do to please this woman?*

The cruise from hell was still underway.


## Mykonos Betrayal

We slept till 11, caught the 12:10 tender, and let Mykonos do its postcard thing—white alleys, blue shutters, bougainvillea in impossible pinks.

A bar right on the water. Aperol for her, beer for me. The food was gorgeous; the view, stupendous. Then she went quiet. She'd heard a group—Spanish, maybe Brazilian—talking about us. I watched the shame tank fill. She folded; I folded into anger. Perfect painting, no appetite.

"Text your sisters. Meet them for the afternoon," I said. I paid and walked toward the windmills, did the tourist loop. It didn't take.

Back to the ship. We needed to be ashore by 18:15 to meet the dinner tour coach at 18:30.

17:20: she slipped into the cabin, breathless. Panic spiked. I told her to get ready fast, I'd stall them.

Tender back. Luca was there, sent ahead while the girls got ready. I found an organizer who waved it off: not a coach tour—just dinner in Little Venice. I texted Julia.

Luca and I found a bar overlooking the harbour. One beer, then another. I filled him in—3.5 years, my age, the whole arc. On the second beer he dropped it, casual as weather: "That's surprising. Julia told them you two met recently, and she didn't even know you'd be sharing a cabin."

It landed like a dropped anchor. A lie with choreography. The old heat climbed my ribs.

We arrived early at dinner. Julia and the sisters tried to settle elsewhere, but we took the seats opposite. She was technically across from me, but her shoulders stayed forty-five degrees away, her conversation routed anywhere but to me. Embarrassed to be seen with me.

For the tender back she stayed with the girls. On board: "a quick drink with my sisters." Luca and I took another beer. Then I went back to wait.

01:00. The key light blinked green. She came in quietly, rehearsed. I couldn't hide the disappointment—and the rage.

"You're a lying, cheating bitch. I hate you. I can't stand to look at you. You're a hypocrite. We're finished." I meant every word for the five seconds it took to say them.

She said nothing. Packed her cabin bag with efficiency. Slipped out to sleep with her sisters.

The cruise from hell had wrecked me again.


## Santorini & White Night

Santorini bus tour. Julia and I stuck on the same coach, opposite ends. Archaeological site, capital, Oia—we orbited separately.

That evening: White Night. I ate dinner solo. She avoided me, ate pizza alone, changed into the white dress, joined her sisters.

Deck 11: Jane came to the bar. "She's sad, but she's looking for you everywhere."

Eventually Julia walked over. "Hi."

"Hi."

Something thawed. Later in the room we talked. She told me how deep last night's words had cut—*bitch, hate, nothing more*. I apologized. She explained the Luca lie: he'd been flirting; she didn't want to feed him our history or hurt her friend.

We let the quiet sit. She stayed the night—in my bed at a distance. No sex. Her back to me. Tomorrow would ask its own questions. Tonight was a pause.


## Reconciliation & At Sea

We spent most of the morning in bed doing nothing that counted as romance. She slept long and honest; I lay beside her tapping app ideas into my phone while the ship carried us.

By afternoon the truce felt serviceable. She drifted off to find the girls. Another theme night—she pulled out the short black-and-white mini: square neckline, white trim, hem high. The room took a breath. She left at 18:00 to meet her sisters and tour the ship for selfies.

At 21:15 I met them on the open deck—still giggling, still doing the thing where each woman is director, photographer, and hype squad. Dinner was good. Simple, almost easy.

After, I peeled off. Tired, drunk, stomach off. In the cabin the air-con made its clean weather; I floated for half an hour, then went looking for the night.

Deck 11—found them. We danced. Nothing ambitious. They were in that mood that feeds itself. I let the orbit carry me, then excused myself.

Later she came back. No speeches. She slid in and put my hand where she wanted it. The lipstick vibrator did its job; my mouth did mine. She came hard, went still. I didn't get an erection. Tender, technical, almost first aid.

Tomorrow was Ancona. We told ourselves we were on better terms. We were, in the way a sea is calm when you're standing on the one square metre that isn't moving.


## Ancona Daylight - The Last Good Moment

The day started soft. No sex. Just two bodies remembering each other—her calf across my shin, my hand over her ribs. We showered, dressed, stepped off as if Santorini hadn't happened.

Ancona was a shrug. Cobblestones, crumbling churches, gelato that melted faster than conversation. The important part: we didn't argue.

Back aboard just before four. I lay under the window feeling something I hadn't in days—safety. The fragile illusion we were okay.

From the bathroom: "Close your eyes."

What followed lives in Chapter 1—the turquoise, the hush, the laughter after. For a few minutes, I believed it again.


## Golden Hour - The Rooftop Photoshoot

By evening the garment bag came out. The red dress—corset tight, honest slit—turned the mirror into an accomplice. Sisters dabbed gloss, checked heel straps; I carried the spare pair.

Deck 12: wind, salt, metal. The ship's photographer claimed a patch of light. "Chin up—hold—look left—now laugh." Reflector bobbing. Phones out. A circle forming.

She glowed. Sisters worked the edges. I hovered three paces back, proud and spare.

That's when he appeared: linen white, sunglasses, a little belly and a lot of money. Watch heavy. Shirt open. He moved through the crowd the way men do when doors open before they knock. Went straight to her. A lean in. A line in her ear. A laugh. A short exchange where numbers live.

The light thinned. Photographer wrapped.

In the cabin she unzipped red, reached for white. Kissed my cheek. "One last drink with the girls. Meet you at 9:30?"

The red lay on the chair like a flag that had done its job.


## The Vanishing Night - Abandoned at Dinner

9:30 came and went. Then 10. Then 10:30.

I sat alone at our table by the railing. The sea kept its counsel. One candle between two wineglasses; one stayed untouched. When the waiter asked, "Is Julia joining you?" I lied—she's a bit sick. He nodded, came back twice anyway, the way good men do when they know someone is drowning quietly.

After dinner I searched. Spa. Bars. Deck. Nightclub. Buffet. No Julia.

The sisters were at Deck 11. "She never showed," one said. "We thought she was with you."

I managed a smile and walked. Back to the cabin. Shattered.

2:07 a.m. The phone vibrated and lit the room.

I knew what kind of message uses that tone at that hour.


## Night Watch - The 2:07am Message

2:07 a.m. The phone vibrated and carved a small white square out of the dark. I turned it over and read:

**Julia — Saturday 2:07 a.m.**

*My love…*

*I'm sorry. I can't come back.*

*You said you would make me a goddess, and you did.*

*Told me I could command any room, win any heart.*

*And I won a new heart this evening.*

*You always told me I could do it.*

*That our love was impossible.*

*That I had to look to my future. Find a younger man.*

*Well… he's not much younger.*

*But he made me an offer that could change everything.*

*He said he can make me a star — my clothes brand, my modelling career.*

*A $10M signed contract.*

*But only if I leave you behind.*

*I didn't plan this. It just happened.*

*Please don't hate me.*

*I still love you.*

*But I have to go.*

*You'll be contacted for my stuff.*

*Please pack my dresses and take them home.*

*That's my last request.*

*— J*

It landed softly and then in instalments, the way truth always does.

It was the last night. Cases had to be packed before dawn. The corridor was already lined with suitcases wearing their barcoded tags.

I pulled our big case onto the bed and began to pack her side—the kind of work that looks like love from a distance.

The red dress folded along its seam. One heel from under the bed, strap twisted like a question. Her earrings from the shelf, cool as coins. Make-up bag. Charger. The black dress on the chair.

Zip. Tag. The handle clicked like a notarised fact. I wheeled it into the corridor. The door thudded shut with the finality hotels and ships have perfected.

We weren't a morality play. We were a transaction of transformations. I made a goddess out of a girl who'd been told to be small; she made a confessional out of a man who'd been told to be finished.

I had met her. I had transformed her. I had financed her.

She had denied me three times, then found me again, then been bought by another.

When sleep came, it wasn't mercy. It was logistics.


## White Dress, White Linen - Dawn Departure

At dawn I drew the curtain. A small launch cut the calm toward shore; white linen beside a simple white dress. Not waving. Not turning. Just gone.

Beyond that, you know the story.
