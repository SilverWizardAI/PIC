# Chapter 10: Returning Goddess

## The Airport Ordeal

Her return from Ayia Napa was a fucking disaster.

Two layovers. Over 28 hours in transit. Missed her final connection—the one I'd paid €300 for. She didn't check in on time. I never got a straight answer why.

Maybe sick. Maybe distracted. Maybe she just didn't give a fuck anymore.

She spent a night and a day stranded at Larnaca, curled up on hard chairs. No sleep. Barely enough energy to move.

She felt dirty, sick, drained. Couldn't eat. Couldn't even cry.

Her voice notes sounded hollow—like the aftershock of trauma she didn't understand yet.

And she kept messaging me. A steady stream of texts, audios, updates.

I thought it meant something. Thought I was still her emotional anchor—the one she turned to when everything fell apart.

But I wasn't the only one she was texting.

Bouquet knew exactly when she was coming back. He'd offered to pick her up. He was working, so he couldn't—but he was involved.

She had two men orbiting her misery like satellites, both trying to help, both worried sick.

I just didn't know I wasn't the only sanctuary.

Not yet.

## The Hidden Friday Hotel Night

She didn't come straight to me.

I wanted to see her Friday—the day she finally made it back from hell. But she was too tired. Needed rest. Her sisters wanted time.

Everything except the truth.

What I wouldn't find out until later: she spent Friday evening in a hotel with Bouquet.

Another night. Another bed. Another man trying to win her.

He pretended Ayia Napa hadn't changed anything.

He showered her. Flowers. Wine. Biltong. A list of every small pleasure turned into an offering—as if generosity could drown out betrayal.

He told her nothing had changed. She was still his girl. Everything was fine.

She even told him about Zürich—weeks before she told me—and still he brushed it off.

"That was just a fling. Stuff like that happens on vacation. It's not a big deal."

He'd already forgotten it. Nothing to work through. They didn't need to talk.

She pushed back. They had to talk about it. Had to process what happened.

He smiled: "Don't worry, I've forgotten it already."

And that's when she knew she couldn't trust him anymore.

He forgave too easily. Acted like none of it mattered. He saw it as kindness—she saw it as weakness. Unreality. Denial.

If he could forget Ayia Napa so easily… maybe he could forget her just as fast.

Strangely, while I was semi-hating her—feeling used, lied to, treated like a cross between an ATM and the Red Cross—he was forgiving her completely.

And that's what made him lose her.

Not the betrayal. But the way he pretended it never happened.

Saturday: more time, more calm, more pretending.

She didn't tell me any of this. Made excuses about her sisters again. Busy. Tired. Next time.

Juggling men like truths. Keeping us in separate containers.

Bouquet got fantasy. I got frustration.

He got flowers and hotel sheets. I got radio silence.

And still, on Sunday… she came to me.

Not as a woman caught between two men.

She came dressed like a gift.

## The Green Dress Homecoming

She came to me on Sunday.

I hadn't seen her in almost two weeks. And when she showed up at my door, she looked... fucking devastating.

Short green dress. Not elegant—slutty. Clinging to every curve like wet paint. The fabric thin enough to see the shape of her hips, the curve of her ass, the outline of absolutely nothing underneath. No bra. Just soft skin and erect nipples pressing through the cotton like punctuation marks.

Tits out. Attitude underneath.

I was still sore. Still suspicious. Still halfway convinced she'd spent the weekend fucking someone else.

But the minute she walked in, all of that collapsed into pure animal want.

She didn't say hello. Didn't apologize. Didn't explain.

She just walked straight to my couch, climbed onto my lap, and wrapped her arms around my neck like nothing had ever broken between us.

Her breath was warm on my throat. Her thighs straddled mine. The dress rode up. I could feel the heat of her pussy through my jeans—already wet, already ready.

My hands found her tits. Heavy. Soft. Perfect. I took her nipples in my mouth—first one, then the other—sucking hard enough to make her gasp.

She started grinding. Slow at first, teasing herself on the ridge of my cock. Then harder. Needier. That squirming, rolling motion only she had—hips circling, pussy pressed down, searching for friction.

I yanked my jeans open. She lifted just enough for me to slide in.

And then she rode me.

Not gentle. Not romantic. Hard. Deliberate. Grinding herself down onto me like she was trying to fuck the memory of someone else out of both of us.

Her head fell back. My hands dug into her ass, pulling her deeper. And when she came, she came *hard*—pussy clenching, thighs shaking, a breathy moan that broke into something close to a sob.

Her wetness soaked through onto my thighs.

But we weren't done.

I stood, pulled her up with me, and walked her to the kitchen. Bent her over the counter. Pulled the dress up over her hips.

She braced her hands on the tiles. I pushed into her from behind—deep, slow, then harder. Her moans turned to cries. Her hips pushed back to meet me.

And then it happened.

Her legs started shaking. Her hips buckled. She tried to hold herself up, couldn't. And she squirted—hard, messy, all over my kitchen floor.

I felt her body twitch as I held her in place. Watched the puddle spread beneath us.

*That* was mine. That moment. That chaos.

Afterwards, while I grabbed a towel and she caught her breath, she said something strange.

Said she'd run into Bouquet that morning on her way out. He'd seen her in the green dress and asked:

*"Why do you look so sexy?"*

She told him she was going to visit a friend.

Another lie.

Just like the ones she'd fed me on Friday and Saturday.

I didn't question it at the time. Didn't push. Didn't want to crack the glass. I hadn't known about the Friday hotel yet. Or the Saturday encore. I just knew she was here now—dripping and soft and mine, at least for the afternoon.

But even in that post-orgasm haze, something in me had shifted.

I didn't trust her. Not fully.

And I don't think she trusted me either.

Her body came like it trusted me. But her soul kept something locked behind her teeth.

## I Stopped Fully Believing in Her

Even as I cleaned the floor, even as she kissed my shoulder and told me she'd missed me, something inside me had changed.

I didn't trust her.

Not because she came too hard. Or because she wore the green dress for both of us. But because something in her eyes had gone quiet. Calculated. Like she was waiting to see what version of me would show up next: the lover, the financier, the fool.

She didn't tell me about Friday night with Bouquet. Or Saturday either. Didn't tell me he'd tried to reboot their romance with gifts, wine, and flattery. That he'd pretended Ayia Napa hadn't happened. That she'd tested his memory—and found him forgetful by choice.

She didn't tell me about Zürich. Not yet. Not the club. Not the fingers. Not the screaming match. None of it.

But I could feel it anyway.

You don't need to know a story to sense its weight. Her body came like it trusted me. But her soul kept something behind her teeth.

And I think I knew, in that moment, that she was still splitting herself between worlds.

She hadn't chosen. She hadn't landed. She was with me—but still out there, somewhere.

And I? I was no longer sure I wanted her to come back fully.

## My Revenge: Seeking.com and Sex Spree

Something in me broke during those three weeks of Bouquet and Ayia Napa.

Not loudly. But with quiet precision—like a man unscrewing a bomb he no longer wants to carry.

I stopped trying to win her back.

Started pushing her away. Not with cruelty. By instinct.

I needed to stop being the donkey. Needed to find other donkeys for her.

I told her to go back on Seeking.com. Meet men. Ask for what she wanted—money, gifts, attention. Set terms. Be clear about sex. Agree a price. Get paid. Learn the game.

I wasn't joking.

I chose the photos, wrote her profile, gave her draft texts. Told her how to negotiate. Warned her not to fuck unless payment was upfront.

I became her pimp. Or her consultant. A strange hybrid of sadist and mentor.

She didn't like it. Said I was pushing her to other men so I could see other women.

She was right.

Because I wasn't just pushing her into the wild—I was already out there.

The week after she got back from Ayia Napa, I fucked three new women.

The first was a Portuguese-Indian beauty who came sixty times in one afternoon. Her body just kept coming. Five thrusts, another orgasm. Breathless. Sweaty. Trembling. Legs sore for two days.

Then two more, back-to-back. I didn't remember their names or faces. Just the curve of their tits and hips.

I was on a mission. Not to feel pleasure. To prove I still had power.

To erase the image of Julia dancing in Cyprus clubs, getting fingered by Zürich, soaking someone else's sheets.

I was tired of being the ass. Tired of being the sponsor, the sanctuary, the one she could always come home to after fucking the world.

I wanted her out of her comfort zone. Wanted her to learn that not every man who smiles and pays for dinner is as gentle as me. That some will ghost. Some will lie. Some will fuck her and disappear.

That there's a cost to the game she plays.

And if I was going to be used, I at least wanted to use someone back.

I was angry. I was horny. I was surgical.

## The Breakdown: October 6 to 8

It started with a short message.

"Apparently I have to meet someone from Seeking."

I played it cool.

"Who?"

"To eat or fuck?"

"Agreed a price?"

She dodged. I pushed. Even joked she'd definitely fuck him if he was respectful enough.

Underneath the teasing, I was drawing blood.

She felt it.

On October 8th, the mask cracked:

"I'm here thinking… maybe I need some time."

"Maybe we shouldn't even be friends."

"You push me to other guys so you don't feel guilty about seeing other girls."

"You said you weren't speaking to her… but I always know."

"And I hate the fact that I always know when it's happening."

She'd sniffed it out. My revenge. My spree. The scent of other women in my bed.

And she hated that she could always sense it in real time.

I tried to parry with sarcasm. Said she didn't need much pushing.

Cruel. Defensive.

She knew it.

"Okay."

"Take care."

Two words — and a door slammed.

We didn't speak for a week. For the first time in over a year, I didn't chase her.

Didn't text. Didn't explain. Didn't fix.

I let the silence grow teeth.

What I didn't know yet was that while I sat with clenched fists and unspoken guilt…

She was being fucked by Irish.

And not just fucked.

Claimed.

## The Silence — and Her Revenge Sex with Irish

The silence lasted seven days.

No messages. No voice notes. No green dress. Just… nothing.

I thought I'd taught her a lesson. Thought she was stewing. Regretting.

She wasn't in mourning. She was in his bed.

Irish. Two metres tall. Ginger. Rough around the edges.

They'd met on Hinge a month earlier — he'd been chasing, she'd been dodging. But after our post-Ayia Napa breakup, something flipped.

She stopped resisting. Started baiting.

She told me the story later — quietly, casually, like describing someone else's dream.

Short red tits-out dress. He looked like he got dressed from a warehouse catalogue for giants. She felt sexy. He looked stunned.

Corner booth. She felt embarrassed. He fumbled with the cutlery.

Red wine did what red wine does.

By the second bar, she was horny, irritated, and hunting. He was still too respectful.

So just before midnight, she locked eyes with him:

"Is there really nothing you'd like to do to me?"

Then kissed him — hard.

In the Uber, she took his hand, placed it between her thighs, let him feel how wet she was. Panties already soaked.

She played with his dick under his jeans.

By the time they got to his place, they were groping and half-undressed.

She pulled him onto the bed, jumped on top, forced his huge cock into her.

Rode him hard. Just like she always did when she was in heat.

She came fast. Then squatted at the edge of the bed and let him slam her for hours — his huge dick crashing into her cervix, over and over.

No subtlety. No rhythm. Just raw flesh and rage and release.

Her stomach ached the next day. Legs shaking. Walked funny for 48 hours.

But she let him continue — wanted him to. Needed to be fucked like she was no one's girlfriend.

Like a fantasy being punished for existing.

They collapsed in a heap. She stayed.

Dirty flat. Dusty sheets. Fucked him again in the morning.

But when she woke up, her skin crawled. The air felt wrong.

Her body had what it needed — everything else was off.

Allergies. Sheets smelled strange. Spell broken.

They never fucked again.

But she didn't walk away either. Kept sleeping there — off and on — for nearly ten weeks.

He fell for her. Hard. Wanted to save her. Fix himself for her.

She pitied him. Even liked him. Thought maybe he needed her to become someone better.

But for her, the mission was already over.

Revenge sex: done.

Power: reclaimed.

Sin: chosen.

She hadn't loved him. But she'd used him.

Because after Ayia Napa — after being hunted, fingered, fucked, lied to, forgiven, and pitied — she didn't want to be prey anymore.

She wanted to be the predator.

## The Return: October 15 to 16

Day eight. I texted "good morning."

12 hours later, she answered… then deleted it before I could read.

At 4 am I caught the ghost: "Well at least you answered me, but then deleted it."

Silence.

12 hours later, she cracked:

"I miss you so much. I've been really bad since last week. I got sick. I can't sleep. So much has happened."

I read it three times. Heart thudding.

Relief or dread? Both.

I offered tenderness. She softened.

"I was in Antwerp last weekend with my dad and sister."

Antwerp. My city for fifteen years. She knew.

Dropped it like a test.

She didn't mention Irish. Not the red dress. Not the bruised cervix. Not the Uber handjobs.

But she told me just enough to make me wonder, keep the door open, make sure I still burned.

And of course, I let her back in.

Not fully. Not yet.

But emotionally? She never really left.

Because even after all of it…

I was still the sanctuary.

She was still my goddess.

And I was still the ass.

## Epilogue: The Fantasy That Died Twice

I always hoped Bouquet would become the ass.

That he'd take over the weight—the bills, the emotional caretaking. He wasn't very sexual, so maybe I could still fuck her. Still have the wildness while he held the softness. The burden.

A perfect triangle. Private arrangement, public deniability.

But after Ayia Napa, she burned that bridge fast. Couldn't trust his forgiveness. Couldn't respect how quickly he forgot.

The dream died quietly in the smoke.

So I turned to Seeking.com—not to punish her, but to build her another Bouquet. Someone stable. Soft. Financially generous. Maybe even romantic.

But not a sexual threat.

That dream died with Irish.

Two metres tall. Ginger. Rough around the edges. He spent his money badly—booze, bad takeaways, dusty sheets. No real ambition. No class. No plan.

But he had something else.

A big fucking dick. Enough raw need to match hers. And—strangely—her sympathy.

She liked him. Felt sorry for him.

He knew he couldn't afford her. But he stopped her from looking further.

He wasn't an ass. He wasn't a provider.

He was something far more inconvenient: a sexual rival.

One she actually liked.

Even if she didn't quite understand why.
