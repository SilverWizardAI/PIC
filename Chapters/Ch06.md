# Chapter 6: Julia Goes Full Nympho

## Cyprus Boredom and Cold Arrival
Cyprus had become boring. The sun-drenched biohacking days were fine. But the evenings were empty.
My only regular company was Paul — an old friend who came out from the UK each winter. We'd meet most afternoons at Café Nero, sipping 5 o'clock coffees overlooking Paphos harbour. Paul was six months younger than me but looked thirty years older. He'd once been a long-distance runner, but life — and statins — had worn him down. Skinny, cautious, indecisive. A man slowly shrinking into himself.

{He was a mirror of what I might've become — had I not broken free.}

So when Julia came for her second trip in early May 2024, I was genuinely pleased. She arrived late on a Friday evening after a two-legged flight from Lisbon. I picked her up at the airport and drove her back to my house.
But she was colder than I'd expected. Distant. Her body was there, her eyes were sometimes there — but her soul felt miles away, still curled up in some dark corner of Lisbon, licking wounds I hadn't seen.
She insisted on going to Limassol on Sunday—to visit a girlfriend, she said. At the time, I was pissed off. We had so little time together, and she wanted to spend a big chunk of it away from me. But I let her go. Only later would I realize how important that friend was. She was the one Julia would later travel to Ayia Napa with—the one who stood beside her during the wildest week of her life, when she finally realized she was a 10+. That she could dominate any room. That she could have any man she wanted.
Julia didn't know it then. But something was already shifting. The confidence I'd always told her she had—the power I said she was born to wield—was starting to ignite inside her. Limassol wasn't just girl time. It was the start of the storm.


## Queen: The Nigerian Beauty

Paphos, Queen, and the Storm Before the Storm
It had actually started unraveling much earlier—back in January, when Queen entered the picture.
She was a 21-year-old Nigerian beauty living in Limassol, studying to be a nurse. In many ways she was Julia's equal: big, luscious DDs, tiny waist, perfect bum, a stunning face framed by long black hair. Queen had presence. Quiet power. And mystery. It took effort to get her addicted to me, but once she fell, the sex was electric. Orgasms that echoed across continents.
But she was emotionally elusive. One moment she'd be clawing my back in bed, moaning my name. The next, she'd disappear to Limassol like nothing ever happened. I never fully trusted her. I always felt she was playing some game—testing, teasing, never fully surrendering.
Julia knew about Queen. She'd seen a photo. She realized, instantly, just how beautiful she was. And that made her jealous. Maybe angry. She didn't admit it directly—but the temperature dropped. The next time we spoke, something had changed in her voice.


## Tantric, the Italian, and the Spaniard

In February, it got colder still. Julia confessed, over a string of detached WhatsApp messages, to her two sessions with Tantric. She said they meant little. Just curiosity. But he never really left the picture. Terry—the so-called master—lingered in the background like some toxic fog. He messaged her, invited her to underground sex ceremonies dressed as spiritual circles. He sent her money—not as gifts, but to pay his own bills. And he made promises: be exclusive with him, he said, and he'd give up his other women. She wouldn't need to submit anymore. He'd take care of her. Like a proper man should.

{It was blackmail, dressed as sugar-daddy romance. And I never believed a word of it.}

But the thought that she might believe it—that he might fuck her again, tie her up, ride her like an object on that stupid wooden stool—burned like acid in my mind. Julia never told me everything. Just enough to feed the nightmares.

She was even more vague about the Italian and the Spaniard. Two men who slipped in quietly after Tantric faded but before she came to Cyprus. I didn't know their names. Didn't want to. Just that they kept texting her. Still hoping. And that meant they had fucked her. I didn't know the positions. But I knew the rhythm. One week, then the next. No courtship. No flowers. Just Julia daring the world to take her.

Later, she gave me more detail—a reluctant confession, maybe half-regret, maybe pride.

The Italian had matched with her on Bumble before a business trip to Lisbon. They met for dinner. He impressed her. Forty-five, good-looking, confident. She said no the first night. But the second night, she said yes. The wine, the compliments, the slow drip of anticipation—and her libido, always vulnerable to red wine, lit up like fireworks. She went to his hotel. He had a huge cock. She was nervous. But he was a skilled lover. He got her wet, got her open, and took her deep. She rode him hard. And then let him ride her harder.


## The Spaniard: Four Hours and a Camera

The next week, it was the Spaniard.
Also a Bumble match. Also a visitor. They flirted over dinner. She was still hungry. Still lit up from the Italian. She told the Spaniard to take her back to his hotel. They fucked for four hours, pausing only for sensual showers to cool off, then reheat. He had a big dick too—not as thick, but long, nine inches. He was obsessed with the way her tits bounced when she rode him. He even asked to film her. She said yes. It was the only time she ever let a man video her. Something she later regretted deeply. She never knew what he did with that footage. She hoped he only used it to masturbate. But she never stopped wondering if it had spread.
He became addicted to her. Still texts her. But never saw her again.


## The American: The Ericeira Fuckfest

Then came the American.
She met him by chance on the university campus. A smile exchanged in passing, followed by a second encounter, then words. He told her she was gorgeous. They exchanged WhatsApps. Their first date was brief—but it ended with them fucking in the back of his car. It wasn't romance. It was fire.
But fire needs feeding. So the day before she flew to Cyprus to see me, they checked into a hotel in Lisbon. She told me later they barely spoke. They just fucked. And fucked. And fucked. He had a huge dick that gave her stomach aches for days, but that didn't stop her when she was in heat. They were so loud that the hotel manager banged on the door. When he saw it was a white man with a beautiful Black woman, he snapped. Said it was a family hotel. Called her names. A Black whore. Told them to leave. The American defended her. But they left anyway.
I didn't know any of that at the time. She arrived in Cyprus cold, distant, still soaked in the scent of him. But the worst blow came a week later. I was in Kyrenia with Pepper—a Rihanna lookalike, another Nigerian beauty. And Julia, in the middle of that weekend, texted me from Ericeira.

"I've just spent two days fucking the American," she said. "We barely spoke. It was just sex. Nonstop."

It broke me. Not just the sex. The emptiness of it. The way she surrendered to pure animal lust, no bond, no talk. Just heat.

{That was the beginning of the end.}


## The Tigress in Heat

When she came back from Limassol that Sunday, she showered and dressed up and we went to her favourite South African restaurant in Paphos. The one that served biltong—that salty dried meat South Africans love, and that she'd loved when studying in Cape Town.
But something wasn't right. The dinner was cool, disconnected. I'd later realise it was her shame tank filling. That public discomfort of being seen out with an older white man, even one she adored.
Back at the house, we tried to have sex. My erection was solid, but not steel. She was insatiable. Demanding. She wanted it hard, long, nonstop. She talked constantly—dirty, hypnotic, relentless. But eventually, my dick gave up.
And I said it.
"There are times when you're too much for one man. You could fuck a whole football team and still want more."
She went quiet. Looked at me strangely.
"You know," she said, "I've been told that before."

{Maybe it was the Spaniard. Maybe even his nine inches had surrendered to the tigress in heat.}

That was her first peak.
The second came weeks later. In Athens. The infamous bloodbath. The one she told me about in gory detail. Period sex. Sheets ruined. Twice. The apartment turned red and raw. But no shame. No pause. They did it again the next night.
But we'll get to that.
