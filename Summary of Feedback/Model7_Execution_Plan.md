## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)

2. **Community engagement high** (daily activity, Steven Harde responsive)
3. **Book restructuring complete** by Week 7 (no delays pushing launch)
4. **Founding member tier converting** (20+ members = proof of concept)
5. **Amazon pre-order live** by Week 8 (gives sales runway)

### Nice-to-Haves (Optimizers)
1. Paid ads generating positive ROI
2. Early reviews (5+ on Amazon/Goodreads)
3. Book club adoption starting

### Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Low email list growth | Launch has no audience | Increase excerpt frequency, paid ads, Reddit outreach |
| Community engagement flat | No funnel to members | Daily Steven Harde engagement, discussion prompts, AMAs |
| Book restructuring delayed | Launch pushed back | Hire professional editor (not DIY), fixed weekly milestones |
| Amazon ranking doesn't climb | Low visibility | Goodreads giveaway, early reviews, category optimization |
| Paid ads underperform | Money wasted | A/B test early, pivot to organic if not working |
