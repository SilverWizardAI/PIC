# MODEL 7 EDITING NOTES
## Generic Categories of Change (NOT Chapter-Specific)

---

## WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE (High-Level)

### 1. SEXUAL CONTENT EXPANSION
- Add MORE sex scenes (not just expand existing ones)
- Make sex scenes MORE EXPLICIT (detail, sensation, arousal)
- Make sex CENTRAL to story meaning (not background)
- Integrate sexuality to show power dynamics, not just for titillation

### 2. JULIA'S VOICE STRENGTHENING
- Add Julia POV in chapters where she's currently narrator-filtered
- Show Julia's ACTUAL thoughts and feelings, not narrator's interpretation of her
- Make Julia's interiority as rich as narrator's
- Show Julia's agency and desire clearly (she CHOOSES, even when constrained)

### 3. POWER DYNAMICS CLARIFICATION
- Make power imbalances EXPLICIT (age, money, control, desire)
- Show power SHIFTING (Julia gaining agency, narrator losing control)
- Make each sexual encounter show power negotiation
- Show that Julia UNDERSTANDS the dynamic and chooses to participate (agency)

### 4. EROTIC LITERARY TONE
- Sensuality in descriptions (not just explicit acts)
- Psychological sophistication (not just bodies, also minds)
- Desire shown as COMPLEX (not simple attraction)
- Integration of sex to character/relationship revelation

### 5. CLIMAX DRAMATIZATION
- Ensure all pivotal moments are DRAMATIZED (shown, not summarized)
- Reader witnesses key decisions/moments, not told about them
- Especially: climactic moments, relationship shifts, final choices

## WHAT STAYS THE SAME

- Non-linear structure (as-is)
- Narrator's unreliability (as-is)
- Psychological sophistication (as-is)
- Literary quality prose (as-is)
- Core story/relationship arc (as-is)

---

## TARGET OUTCOME

**After editing, the book should be:**
- ✓ Erotic (sexuality is central and explicit)
- ✓ Literary (psychological depth, unreliable narrator, sophisticated prose)
- ✓ Julia-voiced (her POV present in 5-7 chapters minimum)
- ✓ Power-dynamic clear (what's happening between them is visible)
- ✓ Fully dramatized (no key moments summarized)
- ✓ Positioned for Model 7 (shareable, discussable, funnel-driving)

## WORD COUNT EXPECTATION

- Current: 52,770 words
- Target: 62,000-68,000 words
- Expansion: 9,000-15,000 words
- This is additions (new sex scenes, Julia POV), not bloat

## APPROVAL CHECKPOINT

When you return with revised manuscript:
1. I read full revised version
2. I evaluate against these generic WHAT categories
3. If all categories met: proceed
4. If gaps remain: specific per-chapter prompts for next round
