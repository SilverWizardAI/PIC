## Chapter 1 Restructuring Complete - 2026-02-22 ✅

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Summary

Restructured Ch01 opening to follow Model 7 methodology: removed separate "Return from Ancona" scene, merged context into narrator's waiting moment, and added Julia POV for "the switch" passage. Book now opens with immediate sensory hook.

### Changes Made

**Structural:**
- Removed "Return from Ancona" as standalone scene
- Merged Ancona/fragile peace/morning tenderness reflection into narrator's waiting moment (lines 7-21)
- Book now opens: "Back in the cabin, she disappeared into the bathroom without a word—but with a mischievous grin."
- All H2 section headers preserved for navigation

**Voice & POV:**
- Added Julia POV section to "the switch" moment (lines 159-183)
- Julia reflects on previous lovers: Mr. Tantric, Italian, Spanish, American surfer
- Clarified power dynamics through her unfiltered voice
- Established why Steve is different: he knows her body as a language, not a puzzle

**Content Refinements:**
- Italian: "his thick 10 inch dick looked so good, but hurt so"
- Spanish: texting for OnlyFans retakes (not ghosting)
- American surfer: texting daily for 6 months (inconsistent attention)
- Julia's realization: They maintained unwanted contact; only Steve truly knows her

### Commit

```
30d953c refactor(ch01): restructure opening and integrate Julia POV
```

### Next Steps

- Apply same restructuring methodology to remaining chapters
- Add Julia POV to Ch03-06, Ch08, Ch10, Ch12-13 (Priority 3 chapters)
- Dramatize summarized moments in Ch05-06, Ch11-12 (Priority 2)
