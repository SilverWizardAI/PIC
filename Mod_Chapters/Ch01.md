# Chapter 1: The Goddess Revealed

Back in the cabin, she disappeared into the bathroom without a word—but with a mischievous grin.

I lay on the bed under the big window, arms behind my head, legs sprawled, watching the late afternoon sunlight paint gold across the white sheets. The cabin was small but bright—floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the Adriatic, the kind of luxury that makes you forget you're trapped on a floating mall with 3,000 strangers.

We'd just gotten back from Ancona. That dull, forgettable tour of cobbled streets and crumbling churches, the kind of throwaway stop cruise companies toss into the itinerary just to fill the days before the big Venice finale. We'd wandered. Bought gelato. Snapped photos we'd never look at again. She'd worn that white sundress with the spaghetti straps, and I'd squinted into the sun, both of us performing the pantomime of a couple who hadn't nearly destroyed each other three days earlier in Santorini.

But we hadn't argued. Not like we did in Mykonos, where she'd stormed off the beach in tears. Not like Santorini, where the rupture had been so violent I still didn't understand how we'd survived it.

This morning had started soft. Tender, even. No sex—just the warmth of two naked bodies slowly rediscovering each other in sleep, like continents drifting back together after tectonic separation. She'd laid her flawless 25-year-old Black leg over my taut, biohacked 73-year-old white body like it was still her favorite place to rest. Like the 48-year gap between us didn't matter.

We'd showered together—her back against my chest, water running over her breasts, my hands on her stomach, both of us silent and careful, like we were handling something fragile and irreplaceable. We'd dressed. We'd stepped off the ship as if the Santorini rupture had never happened.

And in a way, it hadn't. Not yet.

The real explosion was still hours away. But I didn't know that. All I knew, walking back up the gangway with her hand in mine, was that we'd made it through another day without breaking.

And that felt like victory.

I felt something now that I hadn't felt in weeks: **safety**. That fragile illusion that we were okay again. That the cuddles this morning meant something. That maybe this cruise—and the missed funeral, the one my family would never forgive me for—had been the right move after all. That maybe, just maybe, the wounds were healing.

I heard the shower run. Then stop. The rustle of fabric. The click of something being unzipped.

Minutes passed.

Then she called out from behind the door, her voice playful and commanding at once.

"Close your eyes."

I smiled, my heart already climbing.

"Why?"

"Because I said so."

So I did.

I closed my eyes and felt the cabin shrink to just sound and anticipation. The creak of the bathroom door opening. The whisper of silk against skin. The click-click-click of her heels on the tiled floor—sharp, deliberate, coming closer.

And then: nothing.

Just the beat of my own heart, climbing faster now.

Just the hum of the ship's engines, deep and rhythmic beneath us.

Just the knowledge that she was standing there, somewhere close, watching me with my eyes closed, vulnerable and waiting.

The power dynamic had shifted. She knew it. I knew it. And she'd engineered it deliberately—every element calculated. The command in her voice ("Close your eyes"). The theatrical timing. The entrance. This wasn't something happening to her. This was her taking control of the moment, of me, of what came next.

This was her show.

I felt her weight on the bed—a knee pressing into the mattress beside my hip. The heat of her body near mine. The scent of her—vanilla body lotion, the faint musk of her skin, something floral I couldn't name.

She leaned down and whispered into my ear, her breath hot and soft.

"Now open."

I opened.

And forgot how to breathe.

She was standing at the foot of the bed in full Victoria's Secret—turquoise lace barely clinging to her glowing, flawless skin. The color made her dark complexion luminous, like she was lit from within. The fabric caught the light in a way that made it look liquid—gossamer, delicate, designed to be seen through rather than worn. I could smell the newness of the lingerie, that fresh synthetic scent mixing with her vanilla lotion, a fragrance that meant she'd put this on specifically for me, in that moment behind the bathroom door.

Her signature Double D breasts swelled under a web of soft fabric, so delicate it looked like sea mist spun into lingerie. The cups were sheer enough to show the dark circles of her areolas, the hardness of her nipples pressing against the lace.

Long satin straps hung loosely down her sides, tied into gentle bows at her hips—like gift-wrapped sin. Like something you unwrap slowly, savoring every second before you destroy it.

Her hips. That perfect hourglass curve that no amount of gym work could fake—it was genetic, ancestral, the kind of body that made men stupid.

Her smooth, dark thighs shimmering under the golden cabin light, the gap between them just visible, the lace barely covering the apex where they met.

And those eyes… serious, playful, powerful. She wasn't asking if I liked it. She was daring me not to.

She wasn't just wearing lingerie. She was claiming it. Claiming me. Claiming the entire goddamn room.

"You like?"

I didn't answer. I couldn't. My mouth had forgotten how to form words.

She already knew.

She could see it in the way my cock was already straining against my shorts. In the way my hands gripped the sheets. In the way I looked at her like she was the only woman who'd ever existed.

And in that moment, she was.

## The Goddess I Created

She crawled onto the bed like a panther—slow, controlled, every movement deliberate.

She kissed me slow at first… then faster—her tongue soft and sweet, then insistent, demanding. Her lips tasted like mint and something darker, addictive. She bit my lower lip gently, then harder, testing how much I could take.

Her hands were everywhere—in my hair, on my chest, sliding down my stomach, tracing the ridges of muscle I'd built over six years of biohacking my way back from 67-year-old defeat to 73-year-old reborn predator.

She rubbed herself against my dick through the lace, hips grinding in slow circles, building friction, building heat, building my anticipation until I was shaking. I could feel the wetness of her through the fabric—hot, slick, ready.

"Remember Ayia Napa?" she whispered, her mouth at my ear.

I did.

I would never forget.

A week alone in Cyprus while I was stuck in Lisbon. Her awakening. The moment she discovered her power.

The Queen of Ayia Napa, I'd called her when she came back. And it wasn't hyperbole.

She'd been crowned there—by Zurich, the Swiss alpha who'd claimed her first, by the devoted barmen and bouncers who competed for her attention, by the drunk pretty girls in their skimpy club outfits who looked like children next to her.

But none of them came close to Julia in her sexy, elegant dresses—the ones we'd designed together, cut low enough to make men lose their train of thought, tight enough to show every curve—crowned always by those impossible Double Ds that defied gravity and logic.

She'd gone to Cyprus as a girl.

She came back as a goddess.

And she never went back to being the innocent girl with braids who came too hard the first time I touched her over three years ago. The one who'd cried in my arms after her first orgasm, overwhelmed and ashamed and grateful all at once.

I believed I created this goddess.

That was my story, anyway. I'd unlocked her, or so I told myself. Taught her how her body worked. Shown her what pleasure felt like when someone actually paid attention instead of taking what they wanted. I'd freed her from Catholic shame and African conservatism and the trauma of every man who'd failed her before me.

But the truth was more complicated. She'd let me unlock her. She'd chosen to learn. She'd decided that pleasure with me was worth more than the safety of remaining untouched. And once she understood what was possible—what her body could do, what her power could be—she became something I could no longer fully control, despite my certainty that I had.

That's what I didn't understand about her. She was grateful for what I'd shown her. And she was already planning how to use it for someone else.

And once awakened, she became unstoppable.

Ayia Napa was just the beginning. After that came Benoît the French dancer, the Tantric cult leader who tried to break her, the parade of younger men with bigger dicks who thought they could own her because I'd told her to explore, to play, to discover what she wanted.

I'd opened the door.

I just didn't realize I'd never be able to close it.

"Slide up on my face," I said, my voice rough.

And she did—peeling the turquoise lace to the side, straddling my head, lowering herself until her pussy was hovering just above my mouth, close enough that I could smell her, taste the air around her.

I gripped her thighs and pulled her down.

Slid my tongue up her slit—slow, deliberate, from bottom to top. The heat of her was incredible, radiating against my face. She was already wet, swollen, ready, and when I spread her with my thumbs to open her fully, she gasped—that sharp intake that meant she hadn't expected such deliberate exposure.

Then found her clit—soft, swollen, alive under my tongue. I could feel it pulse, could feel the rhythm of her heartbeat translated into that tiny bundle of nerve endings. Her taste was sweet and sharp and addictive, like honey cut with salt and something darker, something animal and raw that made my cock ache.

Her thighs shook when I sucked her clit into my mouth—not gradually, but all at once, taking it fully, applying pressure, then releasing, then taking it again. Her hands gripped the headboard so hard her knuckles went pale, and I could feel her trying to control her movement, trying to stay still, but her hips kept rolling toward my mouth, needing more.

Her breath turned to moans and her moans to shouts and her shouts to something wordless and primal as I owned her orgasm with my mouth—not asking permission, not negotiating, just taking what she was giving me and intensifying it until she was shaking and gasping and completely mine in that moment.

She came hard—thighs clamping around my head, back arching, hips grinding against my face like she was trying to fuck my tongue deeper, harder, more.

Then I slid her down.

Arched my back.

And plunged into her.

She gasped—that sharp intake of breath that always came the first time I entered her, no matter how wet she was, no matter how ready. The stretch. The fullness. The way my cock hit angles no one else could find.

She rode me hard—first with her 'twins' in my hands, those impossible breasts spilling over my palms, heavy and soft and perfect. Both nipples in my mouth, one after the other, sucking and biting until she whimpered.

[Julia]

That was the switch. The magic one.

The one I'd been looking for in all the others and never found.

Mr. Tantric had tried to use my body as a tool for his own transcendence—treating my pleasure like something to control and measure, not feel. Left me exhausted but ashamed after each session, like I'd lent him my body and got it back dirty.

The Italian; his thick 10 inch dick looked so good, but hurt so. Stretched me wide. Battered my cervix and left me in pain for days, wondering if that's all I deserved.

Spanish filmed me like I was content, not a person. Four hours of pounding while he angled for the best shot of my tits bouncing. Then texted me every week for a year wanting a retake for his video collection... or was it his OnlyFans account.

The American surfer—two straight days of relentless pounding. Squirt after squirt after squirt until I couldn't anymore. But in between, he could hardly string three words together. But somehow could text me almost daily for 6 months.

All of them were younger. Bigger dicks. Better looking in that conventional way that's supposed to matter but doesn't.

But none of them knew this. None of them found what Steve found—not by accident, but by paying attention. By learning. By understanding that my body wasn't a puzzle to solve but a language to speak.

This. The nipples. This switch that made me shatter.

It meant he actually knew me.

And that terrified me more than anything.

[/Julia]

## Unwrapping My Last Gift

She squatted now, feet planted on either side of my hips, fucking herself on me with complete control—rising until just the tip of me was inside her, then dropping hard, taking me to the cervix, over and over. She held my hands for balance, our fingers interlaced, her eyes locked on mine. She was driving. We both knew it. And she wanted me to know it.

The power in her thighs was incredible. The way she moved—not bouncing like a porn star, but rolling her hips, grinding, rotating, finding the angles that made her gasp. She was reading her own body, using me as the instrument to hit exactly the spots she needed. She understood the mechanics of her own pleasure in a way most women never bothered to learn.

Then she changed position—pulled off me, turned around without me having to ask. She was already anticipating what came next, what she wanted next. Laid herself on her knees at the foot of the bed facing the window, knowing exactly how this would hit her.

The Adriatic stretched out beyond the glass, endless and blue and indifferent to what was happening in this cabin.

She kept her legs close together, always. Said it felt more intense that way. She knew her body. Knew what worked. Wasn't performing for me—was using me. And I understood that was the real power dynamic between us. Not me controlling her. Both of us knowing exactly what we wanted from each other and negotiating it with our bodies instead of words.

I peeled the turquoise lace back slowly—from her hips first, then her waist, then up her spine—like unwrapping the last gift I'd ever get. The fabric caught on her skin, damp with sweat, and I had to ease it over her shoulders, her arms, finally lifting it over her head and tossing it aside.

Her skin gleamed in the golden light—dark and flawless and perfect, every muscle defined, every curve exactly where it should be.

Her ass arched, that impossible curve from lower back to tailbone to the swell of her cheeks. She looked back at me once over her shoulder, hair spilling across her face, and smirked—that look that said *I know exactly what I'm doing to you*.

And then I was inside her.

Doggy. Slow at first. Then fast.

Then teasing—pulling almost all the way out, making her whimper and push back, trying to reclaim me.

Deep thrusts that made her cry out. Then slow withdrawal, watching her squirm and moan and beg without saying a word.

My hands on her hips, gripping hard enough to leave marks. Then on her shoulders, holding her in place. Then one hand sliding around to cup a breast—heavy, soft, the nipple hard against my palm.

I let her fuck herself for a while, my hips still, just letting her rock back and forth on me at her own pace.

She loved that—that it wasn't submission, but choice. That she could take what she wanted, how she wanted it.

Her rhythm built—faster, harder, more desperate—and I could feel her getting close, the way her pussy tightened, the way her breath went ragged.

Then I took over.

Grabbed her hips again. Pulled her back hard onto me with every thrust.

Deep. Cervix-deep. The kind of depth that bordered on pain but somehow wasn't.

She gasped. Tightened. Her whole body went rigid.

I knew she was coming.

But she was trying not to squirt—holding it back, clenching, fighting her own body.

"Bathroom," she said, her voice strained.

I knew what that meant.

She needed the floor. The tiles. The permission to let go completely without flooding the bed.

I pulled out.

She stumbled to her feet, legs shaking, and I followed her into the small bathroom.

## The Bathroom Floor

I bent her over the sink.

Hands on the mirror—her palms flat against the glass, leaving prints. Legs apart, just wide enough. Eyes locked on mine in the reflection.

The bathroom was tiny—white tile, harsh fluorescent light, the scent of sex and vanilla lotion mixing with steam from our earlier shower. We barely fit. But that's what made it perfect.

No room to escape. No room to hold back.

I slid into her again from behind—standing, controlled, relentless. The angle was different here, sharper, hitting spots that made her whimper.

"Now you can relax," I whispered, my mouth at her ear. "Let it go."

She nodded, our eyes still locked in the mirror.

I could see everything—the way her face shifted from tension to surrender, the way her breasts swayed with every thrust, the way her mouth opened in a silent moan.

I angled upward—thrusting from below, targeting the front wall of her pussy where the ridges of her G-spot were deepest.

Then I slowed.

Halfway in, I reached around to her clit.

Found the edge—that outer-inside spot where the hood met the shaft, the place that sent her into orbit every single time.

I massaged it gently at first, then with more pressure, circles and figure-eights and rhythms I'd learned over three years of mapping her body like a sacred text.

And she lost it.

First squirt—hot and sudden, spraying down my thighs, soaking my legs and the floor between us.

"Oh god," she gasped.

Second squirt—stronger, more forceful, her whole body convulsing, her pussy clenching and releasing in waves. It soaked my balls, ran down the inside of her thighs, pooled on the white tiles.

I didn't stop. Kept the pressure on her clit, kept the slow deep thrusts, kept her right on the edge where pleasure turned into something overwhelming and transformative.

Third squirt—full-body, flooding the tiles, splashing against the shower door. Steam rose from the puddle, the heat of her mixing with the cool air.

She collapsed forward against the sink, her legs giving out, but I caught her—one arm around her waist, holding her up, still inside her.

She was trembling. Laughing. Crying. All at once.

Her breath came in ragged gasps, her whole body shaking with aftershocks.

"I can't—" she started, but couldn't finish.

"I know," I said.

We were soaked. The floor was soaked. My knees were soaked. The towels on the rack had somehow gotten splashed.

And the scent of sex hung thick in the air—primal, animal, undeniable.

I pulled out slowly, carefully, and she turned in my arms and buried her face in my chest.

We stood there for a long moment, breathing together, her heart hammering against mine.

---

## Julia's Truth

We moved to the bed somehow, stumbled on shaking legs. I was trembling in a way that had nothing to do with pleasure and everything to do with what I'd just let happen.

That was the first time I'd let go completely with him like that. Squirt. Fully. Not holding back. Every time before, I'd always kept something in reserve—some part of myself that stayed separate, untouched, mine. But in that bathroom, with his hands on me and his voice telling me it was okay, I just... surrendered.

That scared me more than anything.

It would have been easier if it was just about the sex—the incredible sex, the things he could do with my body, the way he knew exactly where to touch me to make me lose my mind. I could have handled that. That was just pleasure. That was just biology.

But this—lying in his arms, feeling the heat of his chest against my back, feeling the weight of his possession and protection all tangled together in a way I couldn't separate—this was dangerous.

In Budapest, when he'd told me to see other guys, I froze because I understood what that meant. He was testing me. He thought he was freeing me, but I saw it as controlling me. And I couldn't live like that.

But this, right now... this felt different. This felt like he meant it. Like I actually mattered to him, not as a body to own or a project to perfect, but as a person.

And if I let myself believe that—if I actually believed he loved me—then what? What happened when I found out he couldn't afford to keep me? When he had to admit that being 73 meant eventual irrelevance, illness, mortality?

I'd seen it already with the others. The flash of interest in their eyes when they thought about what they could offer. The way their attention shifted to me when I was alone with them, the way they looked at me like something to acquire rather than someone to know.

Was I only worth something because he said I was? Not because it was true.

Lying in his arms, breathing in the scent of us—vanilla lotion and sex and the salt of sweat—I made a choice I didn't know I was making.

I chose to believe it. For now. For this moment. For as long as I could.

Because believing felt better than the truth.

## The Rooftop Photoshoot

It was perfect.

The sun hanging low over the Adriatic, painting everything gold. The sea stretching to infinity, calm and blue and indifferent. The upper deck transformed into an impromptu runway, the cruise ship's professional photographer setting up lights and reflectors like we were shooting for Vogue.

Julia in her own dress—the red one we'd designed together over late-night sketches in my Lisbon apartment, the one we'd spent weeks perfecting.

The corset top pulled so tight it nearly spilled her nipples, the boning creating that impossible hourglass that made men forget their own names. The deep front slit ending just below the red lace of her panties—a flash of forbidden when she moved, when she sat, when she crossed her legs. High black patent leather heels that made her legs look endless.

Designed by her. Financed by me. Sewn by a factory in Guangzhou. Delivered to the ship just days earlier, carried aboard like a secret weapon.

She descended onto that deck like a queen returning to claim her court.

Her Black sisters—three gorgeous women in their own right, all curves and confidence and African royalty—flanked her like a royal guard. But even they faded into background when Julia walked into the light.

She glowed.

Not makeup. Not the golden hour sun. Just her—that luminous dark skin, those impossible Double Ds testing the limits of physics and fabric, that face that could stop traffic in any city on earth.

I watched from a few paces back—proud… and invisible.

The creator watching his creation claim the world.

The crowd noticed her.

Everyone noticed her.

Conversations stopped mid-sentence. Wine glasses paused halfway to lips. Men turned like sunflowers tracking the sun. Women stared with that mix of envy and admiration and calculation.

---

## Julia at the Center of the World

The moment I stepped onto that deck, I felt it.

The shift in the air. The weight of every eye turning toward me like I'd flipped a switch in their nervous systems.

I'd felt this before—in nightclubs in Lisbon, on beaches in Cyprus, walking through the streets of Ancona just hours ago. But never quite like this. Never with this much intention. This much design.

The dress wasn't just fabric. It was armor. It was invitation. It was proof.

The corset dug into my ribs with every breath, the boning forcing my posture straight, my breasts high and full, creating a silhouette that didn't exist in nature. The red lace of my panties flashed at the top of the slit every time I moved—deliberate, calculated, just enough to make them wonder what else they weren't seeing.

My heels clicked against the deck like a metronome. Sharp. Precise. Commanding.

I could feel the eyes. The men pretending not to stare. The women cataloging every detail—the dress, the body, the audacity.

And Steve, standing back near the railing, watching me with that mix of pride and sadness I'd learned to recognize. The way he looked at me when he remembered I wouldn't be his forever.

Like he was already losing me.

The photographer—Dimitris, Greek, cocky, professional—gestured me toward the deck chair.

"Lean back. One leg extended. Let the dress fall open. Yes. Perfect. Don't smile. Serious. You're a goddess, not a girl."

I obeyed.

But it wasn't obedience. It was collaboration.

I knew what he wanted before he asked. I'd studied this. Practiced in mirrors. Watched how models moved, how they used their bodies like instruments.

I leaned back, felt the fabric pull tight across my hips, the slit fall open to show the long dark expanse of my thigh. I let my face go neutral—regal, untouchable, the expression Steve had taught me meant power.

The camera clicked. Again. Again.

I felt the heat of the sun on my skin, the slight breeze from the sea cooling the sweat at the base of my neck. The corset made it hard to breathe deep, so every breath was shallow, visible, my breasts rising and falling in a rhythm I knew they were all watching.

Dimitris moved me to the railing. "Look out at the sea. Wind in your hair. Profile. Beautiful."

I turned my face toward the horizon, felt my hair lift and fall, knew the golden light was catching my cheekbone, the curve of my neck, the line of my jaw.

I was performing.

And I was winning.

The crowd had grown. Phones out, pretending to photograph the sunset but angling toward me. I could feel it—the hunger, the wanting, the way I'd become the center of their world just by existing in this dress in this light.

This was what Steve had promised me.

That I could command any room. Win any heart. Make men stupid with want.

He'd been right.

And part of me loved him for showing me this power.

Part of me resented him for making me need his validation to believe it.

## The Italian's Arrival

That's when he appeared.

The Italian. Late 50s, maybe early 60s—hard to tell behind the designer sunglasses that probably cost more than my rent. White linen suit, perfectly tailored, loose enough to hide the slight belly but fitted enough to show money. Cream silk shirt unbuttoned just enough to show gold chain. Heavy Rolex Daytona on his wrist, the kind that costs six figures. Handmade leather loafers, no socks.

A bit of a belly, yes. Thinning hair combed back with expensive product. Not conventionally handsome.

But moneyed. Confident. Immaculately dressed. The kind of man who moves through the world knowing doors open before he reaches them.

He walked straight to her—not hesitating, not asking permission, just claiming space like he owned it.

I was ten feet away. Close enough to see. Not close enough to hear.

He leaned in, his lips near her ear, one hand resting casually on the railing beside her hip—not touching, but close. Territorial.

---

## Julia's Choice Begins

I smelled him before I heard him.

Expensive cologne. Citrus and wood and something darker, heavier. The kind that costs €500 a bottle and announces wealth before a word is spoken.

Then his voice. Low. Italian-accented English. Smooth like aged whiskey.

"You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on this ship. Perhaps the most beautiful I have ever seen anywhere."

I didn't turn immediately. Let him wait. Let the moment stretch.

Then I looked at him—slowly, deliberately, the way Steve taught me to hold power.

Up close, he was older than I'd expected. Late fifties, maybe sixty. But well-maintained. The kind of man who paid for personal trainers, tailors, skincare. The kind who knew his value wasn't in his face.

It was in his bank account.

"Thank you," I said. Neutral. Polite. Letting him do the work.

He smiled. White teeth, professionally done. "I am not a man who wastes time. May I be direct?"

I raised an eyebrow. "You may try."

He liked that. I could see it—the flicker of amusement, the recognition that I wasn't going to make this easy.

Good.

"I am in fashion," he said. "I own production companies, distribution networks, brands you would recognize. And I am always looking for... exceptional talent."

He let the word sit between us. *Exceptional.*

"I would like to discuss a business opportunity with you. Not here. Not now. But tonight. Over dinner. Somewhere private where we can talk seriously."

I felt my heart climb. Felt the flutter of possibility mixed with caution.

This was the moment Steve had prepared me for.

The moment when someone with real power recognized mine.

"What kind of opportunity?" I asked.

He glanced briefly at Steve—still standing back, watching, trying to look casual but failing.

"The kind," he said carefully, "that would change your life. But it requires... commitment. Focus. And perhaps some difficult choices."

I understood immediately.

He was offering me something Steve couldn't.

And the price was Steve.

"I have a boyfriend," I said. Testing.

He smiled again. Gentle. Almost kind.

"I know. The English gentleman. Very devoted. But you are 25, yes? And he is... what, seventy?"

"Seventy-three."

"Bella, a woman like you... you should not be tied to a man who cannot give you the future you deserve. You should be building an empire. Your own brand. Your own wealth. Your own freedom."

I felt something crack open inside me.

The same crack Steve had made in Budapest when he told me to find someone else.

When he told me he couldn't give me a future.

When he told me to live my life—my way, my rules, my joy.

This man was offering exactly that.

"Dinner," I said. "Where?"

He pulled a card from his jacket pocket. Heavy stock, embossed lettering with his name and company.

He turned it over, pulled out a gold pen, wrote something on the back.

"Suite 1247. 8:30pm tonight. We'll have dinner there—private, quiet, where we can talk seriously."

He handed me the card.

"Wear something... beautiful. Though I suspect you could wear anything and stop the world."

He kissed my hand—old-world, theatrical, deliberate.

And then he was gone.

I stood there holding his card, feeling the weight of it in my palm.

Feeling Steve's eyes on me from across the deck.

Knowing everything was about to change.

---

## The Goddess Seen

I watched the exchange from ten feet away.

Couldn't hear the words. But I could read the body language.

The way he leaned in. The way she didn't pull back.

The way she smiled—that calculating smile I'd seen before, the one that meant she was weighing options.

The way she took something from him—a business card, maybe—without hesitation.

The way he kissed her hand like a gentleman from another century.

And the way she watched him walk away, her expression unreadable, the card still in her palm.

Then he was gone—walking away with the casual confidence of a man who gets what he wants, disappearing back into the crowd like a shark sliding back into deep water.

She turned back to the photographer. Smiled. Resumed posing like nothing had happened.

But something had.

I could feel it in my chest. A tightening. A warning.

I only found out afterward what he'd said.

Back in the cabin an hour later, high on adrenaline and success, she was stripping out of the red dress, peeling the corset away from her skin, breathing deep for the first time in an hour. The relief visible in her body—shoulders dropping, ribs expanding, breasts freed from the prison of boning and silk.

Her skin was marked with red lines where the corset had dug in. I traced them with my fingers—gentle, possessive, claiming her even as I felt her slipping away.

I kissed her—tasting her lip gloss, her sweat, her triumph.

"You were incredible up there," I said. "What did that guy in the white suit say to you?"

She brushed it off with a gentle lie, her eyes not quite meeting mine.

"Oh… nothing special. Just said I looked very beautiful. I said thank you."

The lie hung in the air between us.

I knew it was a lie. She knew I knew.

But neither of us said anything.

Then came the text.

Her phone buzzed on the bed. She glanced at the screen, tensed for half a second, then smiled and typed quickly.

"I'm just going for one last drink with the Black girls before dinner," she said, already pulling off the red dress completely, reaching for the short tight white one hanging in the closet. "Will meet you in the restaurant at 9:30, okay?"

The white dress—soft jersey fabric that clung to every curve, deep V-neck that showed the valley between her breasts, hem that ended mid-thigh, bare legs that went on forever. Black heels again. Hair down. Minimal makeup.

Effortlessly devastating.

She kissed my cheek—quick, distracted, already gone in her mind.

And walked out the door.

I stood there in the empty cabin, surrounded by the scattered evidence of the photoshoot—the red dress draped over the chair, the heels kicked off in opposite corners, her makeup scattered across the bathroom counter.

The scent of her perfume lingering in the air.

The feeling that I'd just watched the beginning of the end.

I didn't know it then, but I'd never be this close to her again.

The goddess had been seen.

And someone else was making an offer I couldn't compete with.

[End of Chapter One]
